<body><h3><a name="bookmark0"></a><span class="font4">Viva the Evolution!</span></h3>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">By Debbie Wolfe</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Pssst. The revolution is over. Here’s why.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The first decade of reporting with computers was punctuated by anecdotal progress that was often painfully slow. Many&nbsp;newsrooms had one or two experienced journalists (most often a&nbsp;beat reporter, sometimes a news researcher or news librarian)&nbsp;who served as visionaries sensing that access to electronic public records would radically transform how journalists did their&nbsp;jobs. Most journalists were reluctant to associate themselves&nbsp;with a new way of accessing traditional information.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The chutzpah of change had a high price tag.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Computer hardware and software costs were measured in multiples of $</span><span class="font2">10,000</span><span class="font3"> just to minimally equip a single work&nbsp;station. Blocks of time measured in multiples of months were&nbsp;needed to produce a story or series for the printed page.&nbsp;Convincing bean counters and line editors to commit these&nbsp;resources to a new way of doing things was a very hard sell,&nbsp;especially since the visionaries lacked newsroom rank and colleague support.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The lone rangers began to realize the value of numbers in more ways than just counting records on a 9-track tape.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Annual group therapy sessions for fledgling geeks began at Indiana University in Indianapolis and were later organized by&nbsp;the Investigative Reporters and Editors. The visionaries derived&nbsp;strength and direction from each other. IRE’s mandatory annual&nbsp;membership requirement made its association rolls soar with&nbsp;each new conference. “Computer assisted reporting” and&nbsp;“computer assisted reporting editor” were soon coined as the&nbsp;universal themes for the new electronic revolution in newsrooms. The lone rangers from the special project desks began&nbsp;organizing and learning how to function as a national collective&nbsp;- a CAR team.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">All of this was accomplished without organized hands-on training. Visionaries were self-starters and, for the most part,&nbsp;read manuals to learn how to access and analyze electronic data.&nbsp;Life looked good for a short while.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Then, at the peak of the CAR revolution, there was a revolt.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Beat reporters and increasing numbers of news researchers wanted in on the star status of CAR. They wanted access to&nbsp;technology and the prestige associated with spending months&nbsp;reporting a single story or project.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The price of change was increasing. Bean counters and line editors began to balk. Where was the money for technology&nbsp;going to come from? And if many people in news were researching and writing CAR stories, who would be left to put out the&nbsp;daily paper?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Almost overnight, a shift occurred. IRE’s members once again realized the power of numbers, and team journalism&nbsp;broadened its scope to include the beat reporting troops. The&nbsp;conference in Raleigh, N.C., was a turning point. It emphasized&nbsp;hands-on training labs. Once beat reporters got a taste of the&nbsp;power of electronic records, there was no looking back. How to&nbsp;move forward became the big question.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">How do you get more technology in the newsroom? How do you keep people current in rapidly changing technology? How&nbsp;do you keep from being run over and buried by the information&nbsp;explosion? How do you get CAR in the paper on a regular basis&nbsp;- maybe even every day?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The answer was training. Specifically, hands-on training in local newsrooms.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">For training to work it had to be more frequent than a once-a-year infusion at a national IRE conference, especially since news budgets were not large enough to send every beat reporter&nbsp;who wanted to learn. The job description of CAR editors began&nbsp;to include teaching as well as data acquisition, storage and&nbsp;archiving, analysis, reporting, writing, and editing. People were&nbsp;overwhelmed. A new focus to organize the revolution was&nbsp;needed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The training theme began as a post-conference “what should we do next year” discussion in 1990 when faculty members at&nbsp;Indiana University and a few journalists sat in the bar and tossed&nbsp;around ways to incorporate hands-on sessions. The cost and&nbsp;logistics of setting up just one training lab proved to be a large&nbsp;hurdle.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In 1993, the IRE conference in Raleigh emphasized multiple hands-on training labs and served as a model for what newsrooms should do back on their home turf. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The News &amp; Observer&nbsp;</span><span class="font3">was really the first paper to set up an organized in-house&nbsp;technology training program.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">By the San Jose conference in 1994, the hands-on training issue was picking up steam. The conference continued to have&nbsp;multiple hands-on training rooms and a handful of newspapers&nbsp;had already begun experimenting with in-house technical&nbsp;training programs or “universities.” In these early times,&nbsp;reporters, researchers, or systems editors were wearing training&nbsp;hats in addition to their regular job duties. It was after this&nbsp;conference that the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">St. Petersburg Times</span><span class="font3"> agreed to create a new&nbsp;position for me - they made me a full-time technology trainer&nbsp;for the news department.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The IRE national computer conferences continued to emphasize hands-on training labs, and interest in ways to organize local technical training was starting to gain momentum.&nbsp;Getting IRE to address how news organizations could create&nbsp;their own local training programs was a bit of a straggle.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">At Cleveland’s 1995 conference the issue was addressed in a last-minute roundtable addition to the formal schedule (cochaired by myself and Diane Weeks from </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Washington Post).</span></p><div><img src="when-nerds-and-words-collide - 0056_files/when-nerds-and-words-collide - 0056-1.jpg" style="width:67pt;height:85pt;"/>
<p><span class="font0">Debbie Wolfe is the technology training editor at the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">St. Petersburg Times.</span><span class="font0"> She's been a reporter,&nbsp;managing editor, photojournalist, design editor,&nbsp;special projects editor, journalism educator, and a&nbsp;news researcher. Currently she's the full-time&nbsp;teacher for 400 journalists with more than 40&nbsp;separate classes on computers and electronic&nbsp;information. She also helps supervise beat projects related to technology and public records.</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
