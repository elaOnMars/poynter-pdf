<body><h3><a name="bookmark0"></a><span class="font4">Objects in Mirror Are Closer Than They Appear</span></h3>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">By George Landau</span></p><h4><a name="bookmark1"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">In praise of leather</span></h4>
<p><span class="font3">It was my pal Dan Browning, now the CAR guru at the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Star Tribune</span><span class="font3"> in Minneapolis, who said that we geeks have “the best&nbsp;job in journalism.” He’s right. We get to rummage through&nbsp;electronic filing cabinets in the name of authoritative repotting,&nbsp;we engage in an endless battle with snarled data, and we get to&nbsp;buy new toys more often than anybody else in the newsroom.&nbsp;It’s a sweet career for anyone, and I owe mine almost entirely to&nbsp;the Leather Goddesses of Phobos.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">I was 24 years old in early 1989 when Elliot Jaspin came to town spouting tales of corrupt Rhode Island politicians and&nbsp;reckless bus drivers whom he’d lassoed with spools of 9-track&nbsp;tape. Jaspin was about to start the Missouri Institute for&nbsp;Computer Assisted Reporting in Columbia, Mo. My bosses at&nbsp;the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">St. Louis Post-Dispatch</span><span class="font3"> had hired him for a couple of days to&nbsp;help them choose someone to do computer assisted repotting&nbsp;full time. Only a handful of newspapers had reporters dedicated&nbsp;to CAR in those days, and it was only through the wisdom of&nbsp;projects editor Richard Weil (now the managing editor) that the&nbsp;</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Post-Dispatch</span><span class="font3"> was getting into the game early. It didn’t hurt that&nbsp;a publisher named Ralph Ingersoll had announced plans to start&nbsp;a new daily, the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">St. Louis Sun.</span><span class="font3"> Ingersoll’s competitive threat,&nbsp;which disappeared in a cloud of bankruptcy after just a seven-month run, prompted a brief spurt of newsroom improvements&nbsp;at the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Post-Dispatch,</span><span class="font3"> and Weil managed to sneak computer&nbsp;assisted reporting into the mix.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">I’d spent about five years in full- and part-time gigs at the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Post-Dispatch,</span><span class="font3"> writing features, working general assignment,&nbsp;and rotating through the suburban bureaus. When Weil first&nbsp;asked me if I’d be interested in the job, I knew nothing about&nbsp;computer assisted reporting and next to nothing about relational&nbsp;databases. But it sounded like my dream job, so I bought some&nbsp;books, started reading feverishly, and nervously awaited the&nbsp;interview. As I recall, two or three other folks were being considered for the job. One of them was an import they’d flown in&nbsp;from Atlanta, which made me suspect that my own chances&nbsp;were slim.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In the interview, Jaspin asked most of the questions. The newsroom honchos sat to the side, taking notes. I sweated and tried to sound knowledgeable about relational database theory, but it was&nbsp;clear to everyone that I didn’t know what I was talking about.&nbsp;Near the end of the ordeal, Jaspin asked me if I played computer&nbsp;games. Uh-oh, I thought, he’s making chitchat, which means I’m&nbsp;done for. I said no, not much, although I did enjoy those text-based adventure games, the ones where you have to type your&nbsp;way out of a densely plotted labyrinth. I mentioned “Leather&nbsp;Goddesses of Phobos,” from whom I had been trying to escape&nbsp;for the last few days. I said I didn’t know much about the truly&nbsp;cool games, the ones that had stunning graphics and aerial dogfights. Jaspin smiled politely and said, “Thanks, we’ll get back to&nbsp;you.” I felt like a game show contestant who had struck out and&nbsp;was being sent home with the vacuum cleaner consolation prize.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">I returned sullenly to my desk in the newsroom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">When he later told me I had the job, Weil explained that “Leather Goddesses” had been the clincher. Jaspin had read&nbsp;somewhere that people who enjoyed those text-based mazes&nbsp;were supposed to be good at programming and problemsolving. I was flabbergasted but not inclined to argue.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Over the next 10 years, I became so distracted with data and its distribution in a newsroom that I never found my way off&nbsp;Phobos. Some things are better left as mysteries.</span></p><h4><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Beyond leather</span></h4>
<p><span class="font3">If the preceding narrative has a purpose beyond nostalgia, it’s to illustrate that you don’t need to know anything about&nbsp;computer assisted reporting in order to learn it, master it, and&nbsp;enjoy it. If there’s one principle that has guided me for the last 10&nbsp;years, and which has never failed to unknot my gut in the face of&nbsp;the most intimidating obstacles, it’s that in this field, you can’t&nbsp;ever let yourself believe that you’re done learning.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">What makes CAR the best job in journalism is that the need for constant learning applies equally to reporting and to computers. You can’t be a good reporter if you’ve lost the ability to ask&nbsp;questions and find answers, and you can’t squeeze knowledge&nbsp;from a PC unless you know how to use the software to explore&nbsp;and organize the data. And since the stories and the software are&nbsp;constantly changing, CAR specialists never rest. It’s probably&nbsp;the only career that has so much built-in protection against&nbsp;senile dementia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">When I look back on my 10 years in the field of computer assisted reporting, I see a clear progression from one to many -from starting as a solo act (the guru phase), to building a CAR&nbsp;infrastructure in my newsroom (the engineer phase), to building&nbsp;a set of CAR tools intended for newsrooms everywhere (the entrepreneur phase).</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">I’m not entirely sure about this, but I think that my particular career path and the course of the CAR field itself have been&nbsp;shaped by the same external factor: the availability of networked&nbsp;personal computers. As the network has grown, the role of the&nbsp;CAR specialist has transformed from gura-on-the-mountaintop&nbsp;to a mix of highway engineer and gas station attendant.</span></p><h4><a name="bookmark3"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">A tight grip on the wheel</span></h4>
<p><span class="font3">Back in 1989,1 had the only remotely speedy PC in the entire </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Post-Dispatch</span><span class="font3"> newsroom, so there wasn’t much of an alternative to my becoming a solo act. That’s not all bad, because it</span></p><div>
