<p><span class="font1">Through self-preservation, though, some of these experts have leaned toward managing and maintaining databases for the&nbsp;newsroom, only to find that their job resembles a systems or&nbsp;library role rather than a reporting or editing role. I believe they&nbsp;need to back off that task, or shift their jobs into those departments. That’s because they’re setting up a support operation in&nbsp;the newsroom - one that’s needed and rewarding, but one that’s&nbsp;not reporting or editing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">I realize their management may expect them to do these functions. I realize many experts become byte-heads out of self-preservation. And I realize they want to stay on the cutting edge.&nbsp;But running an intranet is not what anyone went into reporting to&nbsp;do. Putting databases on the web is a production job, not a&nbsp;journalistic job.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">If it’s what these experts </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">do</span><span class="font1"> want to do, then they ought to realize that they’re no longer journalists in the sense that many</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">people define the word. Pretending it is reporting or editing risks diluting the journalistic functions they do perform.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Part of the solution comes from more informed management. And there’s evidence that a new generation of managers - not all&nbsp;of them young - will help smooth this transition. From Pat Stith&nbsp;in Raleigh, N.C., to Shawn McIntosh in Jackson, Miss., former&nbsp;computer assisted reporting experts are infiltrating the ranks of&nbsp;line management. That’s a partial solution.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The rest of the solution comes from within our own community - to better define what we do to more traditional&nbsp;managers, to educate our own editors.</span></p><div>

<p><span class="font1">We should let go of functions that belong elsewhere in the newsroom, or move with them. And we should free the reporters&nbsp;in our newsrooms or ourselves to get back to the jobs we love&nbsp;the most - telling stories, understanding documents in any form,&nbsp;and following the story.</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
