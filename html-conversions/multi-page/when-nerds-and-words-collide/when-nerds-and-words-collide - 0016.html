<p><span class="font2">Announcements range from job openings and a site for online hoaxes to Department of Justice reports on substance abuse and&nbsp;Asian corporate information.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In typical Internet fashion, good statistics are difficult to obtain, but it is probably safe to say CARR-L has several thousand journalists and editors from at least 54 countries. Although&nbsp;Canada and the United States represent about 75 percent of the&nbsp;subscribers, others come from Iran, Singapore, and Australia.&nbsp;The number of journalists from Europe is increasing steadily.&nbsp;Several writers have used subscribers in other countries as&nbsp;sources for story backgrounds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">One of the major advantages of an e-mail list like CARR-L, compared with a World Wide Web interface, is the ability of&nbsp;anybody in the world with some kind of network connection to&nbsp;subscribe to the list. E-mail is the lowest common denominator&nbsp;on the Internet, requiring minimal network and computer&nbsp;resources.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">CARR-L seems to have matured. It has evolved from the enthusiastic first stages of a list, through the confusion of just&nbsp;what the list is “about,” to a certain stability.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">It has remained a place where journalists can get answers to questions and try out story ideas and techniques. A sense of&nbsp;community has evolved among the subscribers, along with a&nbsp;feeling of ownership of “my” list. Generally, when a topic or&nbsp;discussion strays too far afield, subscribers let the offender&nbsp;know. It remains heavily populated by working journalists and&nbsp;news librarians with an admixture of public relations practitioners. CARR-L remains a support group for those who are not in&nbsp;locations with physical connections with other journalists.</span></p><h4><a name="bookmark0"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">CARR-L on campus</span></h4>
<p><span class="font2">Sitting on the academic side, and using the computer resources of an academic institution to support CARR-L, it&nbsp;remains surprising that, with the installed electronic, networking, and academic infrastructure, schools and departments of&nbsp;journalism have been so slow and reluctant to move into new&nbsp;technology. Even within the academy, where journalism might&nbsp;be expected to embrace new technology as a means of communication, other disciplines are leading the way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Computer assisted reporting education at the university level has a spotty and variable history.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In the 1980s, following the lead of most newspapers, most departments and schools of journalism were reluctant to commit&nbsp;resources to this new method of communication. Many remembered the experiments of the previous decade, such as Viewtron,&nbsp;and decided to “wait it out and see what happens.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">As it became more obvious the world was undergoing not a computer revolution (that had already happened), but a communication revolution, some universities began to develop courses,&nbsp;not just for data analysis, but for online acquisition and analysis&nbsp;of information. Computer assisted reporting remains, however,&nbsp;very unevenly distributed across the academic landscape for a&nbsp;variety of reasons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In general, there is a considerable sense of inertia. Senior faculty, who tend to have the leadership role, see little reason to&nbsp;change, and those who do perceive some advantage run up&nbsp;against lack of support from other faculty and administrators.&nbsp;Many just do not have the time to learn a continually changing&nbsp;subject, even though many do have at least one statistics course&nbsp;in their background. And, of course, many suffer from number-and computer-phobia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Junior faculty, who might be expected to bring in new ideas, are unwilling to devote time or effort to a project or subject that will&nbsp;not count toward tenure or promotion decisions. Tom Johnson&nbsp;characterized this as the “fraud of journalism education” (“The&nbsp;Unconscious Fraud of Journalism Education,” </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Quill,</span><span class="font2"> June 1992).</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">There is also a feeling that students just entering the journalism education pipeline will come with a knowledge of&nbsp;“computers.” Unfortunately, computer games and good hand-eye coordination are not much of a basis for computer assisted&nbsp;reporting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Ideally, CAR would be integrated into all classes in a journalism curriculum so CAR becomes just another journalistic&nbsp;tool. In practice, the complexity of today’s computers means a&nbsp;few specific classes taught by interested faculty will integrate&nbsp;computer use. The majority of students will have a separate&nbsp;course, as more universities see the need for trained students,&nbsp;perhaps through the prism of CARR-L.</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">11</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
<p><span class="font2">Hopefully, even though the emphasis will remain on the needs of the practicing professional, CARR-L will remain a virtual&nbsp;newsroom where academics and working journalists can discuss&nbsp;how to use computers to “commit better journalism.”</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
