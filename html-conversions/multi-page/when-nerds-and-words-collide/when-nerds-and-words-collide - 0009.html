<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">By Philip Meyer</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The time has come to abandon “computer assisted reporting” - CAR. It’s an obsolete concept that is starting to get in the way&nbsp;of our understanding of the real battles that we need to fight and&nbsp;win if we are to save the soul of journalism.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">CAR is an embarrassing reminder that we are entering the 21st century as the only profession in which computer users feel&nbsp;the need to call attention to themselves. All of the other professions take computers for granted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">For example:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">My cousin Bob Meyer is a retired accountant, and he uses a computer to audit the books of his boat club, the Marco Island&nbsp;Sail and Power Squadron. He doesn’t call himself a computer&nbsp;assisted accountant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">My daughter Melissa Meyer is an environmental designer in Coral Gables, Fla. She does her creative work on a computer.&nbsp;She doesn’t call herself a computer assisted designer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">My cousins Max and Richard Benne are farmers in St. Joseph County, Mich. They use computers to calculate depreciation on&nbsp;their equipment and to calibrate the fertilizer applications for&nbsp;their corn and soybean fields. They don’t call themselves&nbsp;computer assisted farmers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Let’s forget about the computer and start talking about, and organizing around, what we really want to do. Here’s what I&nbsp;think that is:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Journalism today is in a battle for survival against the forces that would merge it with entertainment, advertising, and public&nbsp;relations. The information age has created such a confusing buzz&nbsp;of voices that it tempts us all to sacrifice almost anything for&nbsp;attention - including truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">What the practitioners of CAR have been after - whether consciously or not - is a higher standard of truthtelling. Our response to the information age has been to learn to manage&nbsp;larger bodies of information with increasingly powerful analytic&nbsp;tools, leading to a more exact definition of truth. As it happens, a&nbsp;computer is helpful in doing that. But the computer itself is not&nbsp;the goal, nor does it define what we are trying to do. We are trying to push journalism toward science. Almost everybody else, it&nbsp;seems on most days, is trying to push it toward ait.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Pushing journalism toward art can justify or mask the merger of reporting and advocacy. It can facilitate the entertainment&nbsp;function of journalism - and we should never deny that entertainment is one of our functions. It can lead to a subjective form&nbsp;of truth in the postmodernist, phenomenological sense. But it&nbsp;will not, in the long run, lead to the building of credibility and&nbsp;trust that journalism needs if it is to survive as an independent&nbsp;information specialty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">One response to information overload has been the elevation of spin. When attention-getting is more important than discovering and imparting the truth, the marketplace rewards those who&nbsp;are skilled at creating appearances. Our goal needs to be to find a&nbsp;way to help that marketplace reward the truth-tellers. The&nbsp;demand is a given. With so much effort devoted to crafty distor</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">tion, the market value of truth has to rise as a function of its scarce supply. All a media company has to do is find a way to&nbsp;brand it and sell it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Our little piece of this action should be the application of scientific method to the practice of journalism. We need to focus&nbsp;on the time-tested methods of overcoming wishful thinking,&nbsp;superstition, selective perception, and the other human frailties&nbsp;that hinder the acquisition of knowledge. We need to build a&nbsp;force in journalism that rewards critical thinking and the skeptical testing of conventional wisdom. Yes, the computer is a tool&nbsp;that can help us do that. But that’s all it is. Focus on the goal, and&nbsp;then we can take the computer for granted, as the farmers and&nbsp;accountants and designers already do.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">My first computer encounter was with the IBM 7090 at the Harvard Computation Center in 1966. Having failed miserably&nbsp;at two successive attempts to predict Ohio election outcomes for&nbsp;the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Akron Beacon Journal,</span><span class="font2"> I was using my Nieman year to study&nbsp;social science research methods. I started with a course for&nbsp;sophomores in which each student was allotted two minutes of&nbsp;the 7090’s CPU time. My 120 seconds produced several&nbsp;cross tabs and significance tests from a survey of junior college&nbsp;students, using Harvard Data-Text, a higher-level programming&nbsp;language that was the harbinger of Statistical Package for the&nbsp;Social Sciences (SPSS).</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">For the second semester, I did advanced work in a graduate course after negotiating a deal with Dwight Sargent, curator of&nbsp;the Nieman Foundation. He gave me $100 to buy computer time&nbsp;in exchange for writing an article for </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Nieman Reports.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">I was back on the job in the Knight Newspapers Washington bureau only a few weeks when the Detroit riot broke out, and I&nbsp;was dispatched to help the staff of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Free Press.</span><span class="font2"> The call came&nbsp;at noon, and that night I was riding with the National Guard&nbsp;amid the burning buildings and sniper fire of 12th Street. When&nbsp;the shooting ended and the fires were out, I proposed a survey of&nbsp;the riot neighborhoods to discover the riot’s underlying causes,&nbsp;applying the principles I had just learned at Harvard.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Of course we used a computer to analyze the results. I recruited University of Michigan professors John Robinson and Nathan Caplan and computer programmer Judith Goldberg to&nbsp;help with the design and analysis. Goldberg did the crosstabs&nbsp;with Filter Tau, a program more primitive than Harvard’s but&nbsp;good enough. It ran on an IBM 360/40.</span></p><div>

<p><span class="font0">Phil Meyer teaches two courses each semester while coordinating the master's program in&nbsp;journalism at the University of North Carolina at&nbsp;Chapel Hill. He currently produces an occasional&nbsp;column of media criticism for </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">USA Today</span><span class="font0"> and&nbsp;researches current trends in newspaper&nbsp;journalism.</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
<p><span class="font2">The response to that project inspired a long-term commitment by me and my management to this new form of journalism -</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
