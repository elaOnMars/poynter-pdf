<body><h3><a name="bookmark0"></a><span class="font3">It’s Time to Drive CAR Concepts Home</span></h3>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">By Stephen K. Doig</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">I like to think of myself as living proof that if you’re bright enough to be a good reporter, you’re bright enough to leam to do&nbsp;computer assisted reporting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Looking back, I now realize I was interested in computer assisted reporting even before I knew I was going to be a&nbsp;reporter. My freshman calculus professor at Dartmouth College&nbsp;in 1966 was John Kemeny, the co-inventor of the BASIC computer language. Kemeny’s novel idea was that computers, which&nbsp;still were Big Iron in those distant days, could and should be&nbsp;used even by us non-techie liberal arts types. I remember almost&nbsp;nothing of calculus today, but the experience of fooling around&nbsp;with BASIC programs stuck with me as I wandered from one&nbsp;major to the next during my on-again, off-again college career.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Arguably, my first CAR effort was in 1974 for a senior-year government paper analyzing the emerging Republican presence&nbsp;in Florida, using the statistics functions built into Dartmouth’s&nbsp;computer system. By that time, during a three-year hiatus from&nbsp;college at the dean’s insistence, the U.S. Army had taught me the&nbsp;rudiments of being a reporter. But it was eight years later before&nbsp;I started doing CAR as a real journalist.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In 1982, I was in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Miami Herald’s</span><span class="font2"> Tallahassee bureau covering state government. At home, I had been reading a lot&nbsp;about hobby computers like the Altair and Apple. Finally, to my&nbsp;wife’s horror, I spent a couple thousand dollars to buy an Atari&nbsp;800 system (loaded with 16K of RAM!), and enjoyed relearning BASIC by writing little programs to teach my kids&nbsp;addition and how to tell time. However, the more I played with&nbsp;the Atari at home, the more I kept realizing how a computer&nbsp;might help me do things as work, such as calculating state budget changes or tracking campaign contribution reports.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">A few months later, the bureau added a reporter and we needed another writing terminal. I persuaded the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Herald</span><span class="font2"> instead to buy one of the new IBM PCs (64K RAM, a 360K floppy, green&nbsp;monochrome screen and a screamin’ 4MHz!). Along with the&nbsp;word processor XyWrite, I bought the PC flavor of VisiCalc, the&nbsp;first spreadsheet, and started using it for budget analyses and&nbsp;other stories. My first real CAR application, though, was a&nbsp;BASIC program I wrote to analyze legislative roll-call votes on&nbsp;deadline. It would take the yeas and nays and churn out&nbsp;crosstabs on the split not just by party, but also by region,&nbsp;gender, race, special interest contributions, leadership vs. rank-and-file, et al. I even made it write out the “How they Voted”&nbsp;agate. (Of course, today such an application can be built in&nbsp;minutes with an off-the-shelf database.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">About the same time, I discovered Phil Meyer and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Precision Journalism.</span><span class="font2"> During his years with Knight Ridder, Meyer was&nbsp;the first in a string of reporters at the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Herald</span><span class="font2"> to use such social&nbsp;science methods as polling and statistical analysis on reporting&nbsp;problems. In about 1983, the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Herald</span><span class="font2"> training depaxtment had&nbsp;brought Meyer, by then a professor at the University of North&nbsp;Carolina, to talk up his precision vision to a handful of math-adept </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Herald</span><span class="font2"> reporters such as Richard Morin (now director of</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">polling for </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Washington Post</span><span class="font2">) and myself. I got a copy of the book, and decided I wanted to be Phil Meyer when I grew up.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">I transferred back to the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Herald’s</span><span class="font2"> main office in 1984, covering courts and then science. But I also missed my Tallahassee IBM, so I spent another couple grand on a PC-XT (with a&nbsp;spacious 10 megabyte hard drive and speedy 1200 baud&nbsp;modem!). In Miami, the same pattern occurred: The more cool&nbsp;things I learned to do on my hobby computer at home, the more I&nbsp;kept seeing ways it could be used at work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">And not just for my own work. It seemed like every day I’d be walking past the desk of some reporter or other, and see him or&nbsp;her doing something like adding up a long column of numbers&nbsp;using a cheap calculator or digging through a thick stack of&nbsp;project notes looking for a particular quote. More and more, I&nbsp;found myself stopping to say, “Hey, I’ve got a way to help you&nbsp;with that.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Before long, I was spending one or two days a week at home, working on other reporters’ projects with my personal computer.&nbsp;(I’m grateful that my editors let me get away with this apparent&nbsp;dereliction of my own work.) After a while, desktop computers&nbsp;started showing up in the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Herald</span><span class="font2"> newsroom - though only on&nbsp;the desks of executive secretaries. So I started sneaking onto one&nbsp;of those computers when the desk’s occupant was out to lunch&nbsp;or had gone home. My contributions to others’ stories, and some&nbsp;projects of my own, finally became visible enough that when the&nbsp;secretaries’ machines were upgraded, I was given one of the&nbsp;hand-me-downs. My career as CAR specialist was semiofficial!</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">My leap into high-end CAR came in 1990 when the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Herald </span><span class="font2">started a project on money-laundering in South Florida. The&nbsp;project reporters came to me and said they could get all sorts of&nbsp;data on 9-track magnetic tape, but they didn’t know how to work&nbsp;with the stuff. Neither did I, but I nodded sagely and said I’d figure something out. As it happened, the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Herald’s</span><span class="font2"> business side&nbsp;had just hired a new vice president to oversee the company’s&nbsp;data processing department. I met her as she was touring the&nbsp;building and mentioned our project. Without missing a beat, she&nbsp;said she’d check into it.</span></p><div><img src="when-nerds-and-words-collide - 0024_files/when-nerds-and-words-collide - 0024-1.jpg" style="width:67pt;height:85pt;"/>

Before Joining ASU in&nbsp;1996, he was research editor of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Miami&nbsp;Herald,</span><span class="font0"> where he worked for 19 years.

<p><span class="font2">Next thing I knew, I was given free and complete access to the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Herald’s</span><span class="font2"> IBM mainframe and enough instruction from the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">real&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">programmers there to soon be writing my own SAS programs&nbsp;and job control language.
