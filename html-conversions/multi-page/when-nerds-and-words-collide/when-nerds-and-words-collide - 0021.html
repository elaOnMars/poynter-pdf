<body><h3><a name="bookmark0"></a><span class="font5">Using People, Not Numbers, to Tell the Story</span></h3>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">By Sarah Cohen</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In inviting speakers to an annual conference on computer assisted reporting last year, I began to hear a new complaint:&nbsp;“That wasn’t computer assisted reporting,” at least a couple of&nbsp;reporters said. “There weren’t any numbers in it.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">That objection - a false one, in my view - is a telling detail in the state of computer assisted reporting in the United States. And&nbsp;it’s one that shapes much of my view of where the specialty is&nbsp;and what we might do to further its development.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Maybe my concern over misconceptions that frame computer assisted reporting as reporting on numbers comes from my&nbsp;unusual background.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">As an economist for a decade before becoming a reporter, I felt that trade focused too much on figures and not enough on&nbsp;people and their problems. Economists, it seemed, had forgotten&nbsp;that the field is much more a human story than a quantitative&nbsp;one.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Soon before I made my career change, a colleague armed with a doctorate in the field solidified the decision.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">He was considering the purchase of a townhouse in a pricey Washington suburb. He complained that a house he preferred&nbsp;down the street was exactly the same, but the sellers were asking&nbsp;“more than the market price.” This economist went on to&nbsp;describe the reasons he preferred the too-expensive one. They&nbsp;ranged from the color of the carpets to the sunshine that poured&nbsp;into the kitchen on cold winter mornings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">I couldn’t get him to understand that the “market price” he sought was just a series of decisions by buyers like him on the&nbsp;value of the color of the caipets and a southern exposure in the&nbsp;kitchen. This, mind you, was someone who’d spent seven years&nbsp;in college studying microeconomics - the field that focuses on&nbsp;how prices are set.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">So came the decision to move to journalism, where reporters and their editors understood that human decisions describe what&nbsp;happens in the national and international economy better than&nbsp;numbers do. And, yes, I was lucky enough to later cover&nbsp;economics and frame the beat in my own words - making and&nbsp;spending money.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">But I was ill-prepared for the surprise I was about to encounter. It never dawned on me that journalists had managed&nbsp;to ignore the tools that had become a mainstay in virtually every&nbsp;other line of work, from economics to cash register design. The&nbsp;information revolution caused partly by the micro-computer and&nbsp;its applications had passed by the very craft that makes its living&nbsp;harnessing information.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Computer assisted reporting was clearly in my future.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">For the past two years, though, I’ve been traveling the country helping others learn to use spreadsheets, databases, and other&nbsp;“computer assisted” tools in the newsroom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There’s probably been more progress during these two years than any other. And it has nothing to do with me.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">As the Internet makes its way onto reporters’ desktops, as personal computers find their way into newsrooms, and as</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">reporters watch how harnessing public records electronically can lead them to great stories, there are terrific examples of successful daily and project work around the country. A few worth&nbsp;noting:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kathy Rizzo, a beat reporter for The Associated Press in&nbsp;Washington, regularly downloads the text of bills into her&nbsp;computer. She transfers lists into a spreadsheet to find examples&nbsp;of pork making their way to her areas.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Lima News</span><span class="font4"> in Ohio acquired a database of pet licenses&nbsp;shortly after my visit there in 1997. Reporters, who knew it was&nbsp;available in their newsroom, searched it for dog owners when&nbsp;Taco Bell began a popular ad campaign featuring Chihuahuas.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">* Dan Keating at </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Miami Herald</span><span class="font4"> was instrumental in a too-rare partnership among editors and beat reporters to document voter fraud. There were few numbers in the ensuing&nbsp;project. Instead, the newspaper documented cases of voter fraud&nbsp;that helped overturn an election and prompted legislative&nbsp;change.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">I highlight these stories because they’re the kinds of stories that </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">should</span><span class="font4"> be more common. Working together to find&nbsp;newsworthy cases, using resources already acquired, and&nbsp;harnessing your desktop for one-minute sorting jobs are the key&nbsp;to using public records electronically.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">I think these are rare for a number of reasons.</span></p><h4><a name="bookmark1"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">The false choice</span></h4>
<p><span class="font4">Unfortunately, many managers and reporters alike have set up a false choice in the newsroom - one that’s illustrated by the&nbsp;speakers’ objection that a story isn’t worthy of a computer assisted reporting panel if it doesn’t include numbers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The choice is between statistics and people in stories, or between social scientists and master storytellers in the newsroom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Instead, the promise of computer assisted reporting has never changed. It remains one of the best ways available to check tips,&nbsp;generate news sources, and help ensure that the moving human&nbsp;stories we tell reflect a larger truth.</span></p><h4><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">The big-bang theory</span></h4>
<p><span class="font4">Reporters and their editors are, by nature, impatient. Otherwise a newscast would never hit the airwaves or a newspaper would never hit the sidewalk. But this impatience gets in the&nbsp;way of reporters learning new skills.</span></p><div><img src="when-nerds-and-words-collide - 0021_files/when-nerds-and-words-collide - 0021-1.jpg" style="width:67pt;height:85pt;"/>
