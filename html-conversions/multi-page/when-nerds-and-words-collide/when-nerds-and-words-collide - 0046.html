<p><span class="font3">graphic census data, health statistics, and electoral data. Such information is not only trustworthy; it holds a vast potential.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It has also been interesting to note how many Latin American government offices, perhaps because their directors want to feel&nbsp;so very modem, have extensive websites. Ironically, much&nbsp;information can be quickly found at these sites that would take&nbsp;days or weeks to find in a traditional press office, given the poor&nbsp;organization or intentional procrastination of the bureaucrats&nbsp;involved.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Last but not least, Latin American reporters also make more frequent use of information from the private sector, including&nbsp;financial and economic data. In this area it is common for&nbsp;information managers to be more willing to share documents&nbsp;that are often available in electronic form and ready for analysis.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Another advantage for Latin American CAR is that many governmental offices and private firms skipped the era of mainframe computers and work mostly with PCs. Therefore, Latin&nbsp;American reporters can usually obtain information in a more&nbsp;accessible format compared with their U.S. colleagues, who&nbsp;struggle with older and clumsier machines.</span></p><h4><a name="bookmark0"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Some examples, some results</span></h4>
<p><span class="font3">Our CAR workshops are usually quite interactive, and many colleagues who take them immediately began to apply the&nbsp;techniques learned. For example, during a Microsoft Access&nbsp;workshop in Brazil, we used a U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service database of legal immigrants to the United States; a&nbsp;few days later one of the reporters ran a front-page story on the&nbsp;“brain drain” of Brazilian executives to the United States, lured&nbsp;by attractive professional offers. It’s true that he was no&nbsp;newcomer to CAR, but we have seen many colleagues with no&nbsp;former training start working on story ideas or at least build a&nbsp;personal database even before the workshop is over.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Some Latin American colleagues are doing very interesting things with their own databases, built from information from&nbsp;paper documents. For example, reporters from the daily&nbsp;</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Publico,</span><span class="font3"> in Guadalajara, Mexico, and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">El Universal,</span><span class="font3"> in Caracas,&nbsp;Venezuela, have done interesting articles on the profile and&nbsp;background of felons convicted for drug-related offenses. In&nbsp;both cases they got the information from judicial sources - in&nbsp;Venezuela it was relatively easy, while in Mexico it was like&nbsp;pulling teeth - to later design their database, enter the data, and&nbsp;analyze it using Access.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Publico</span><span class="font3">’s series was particularly interesting. It showed that only 5 percent of the arrests had been the result of police investigations. The rest resulted after random inspections, tip-offs, or&nbsp;even accidents in which vehicles carrying drugs were involved.&nbsp;These stories also detected glaring inconsistencies in sentencing&nbsp;patterns. For example, a kid caught at home with two dope&nbsp;plants is serving the same jail time as a recurrent smuggler who&nbsp;was captured while transporting dozens of pounds of cocaine.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Latin American reporters also are taking advantage of those fields in which access to information is improving, including&nbsp;official information in digital format. CAR has allowed Jose&nbsp;Roberto Toledo, of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Folha de Sao Paulo</span><span class="font3"> in Brazil, to use statistical information produced by government offices to portray the&nbsp;darker sides of his society. Last year, for example, he used data</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">from the Ministry of Health to inform readers that homicide is the first cause of death among children between </span><span class="font2">10</span><span class="font3"> and 14 years&nbsp;of age in Sao Paulo, and that in many cases the killers are their&nbsp;own parents.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Another fertile area is electoral coverage. In all the countries we have visited we have found a treasure trove of electoral data,&nbsp;compiled by the government or private organizations, which can&nbsp;often be accessed on the Internet. Mexico provides a dramatic&nbsp;example: In the controversial 1988 elections, the results from&nbsp;some polling stations had not arrived in Mexico City one week&nbsp;after the election. In 1994 the now-independent electoral&nbsp;authorities began to deliver the results in the afternoon of&nbsp;election day to several Internet sites, and by dawn Mexican and&nbsp;foreign reporters were analyzing, charting, and mapping the&nbsp;final (albeit unofficial) tally.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">There is a rich vein of information about campaign finances and the relationship between elected officials and private&nbsp;interests that Latin American reporters have not yet fully&nbsp;explored, perhaps because related laws are new in many&nbsp;countries. Information is not as abundant as in the United States,&nbsp;but once again some papers such as </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">El Universal</span><span class="font3"> offer in their&nbsp;websites extensive data in databases created by the paper’s staff.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Latin American reporters also are finding new ways to bypass the hurdles to information in their<sup>-</sup> own countries by using&nbsp;foreign sources. Here the Internet is particularly useful, since it&nbsp;can be used to identify and reach international sources - scholars, journalists, and even government sites - that have relevant&nbsp;information for Latin American countries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Gerardo Reyes, Internet enthusiast, friend, and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Miami Herald </span><span class="font3">reporter, provides a telling anecdote. He was teaching an Internet workshop to a group of Central American journalists, and&nbsp;while he was using the General Accounting Office’s site as an&nbsp;example, a Honduran editor literally jumped out of his chair.&nbsp;Reyes had run into extensive data on U.S. military aid to the&nbsp;Honduran military. The editor ran to the phone to convey this&nbsp;information to his colleagues. The information, he explained, is&nbsp;“classified for national security reasons” in his own country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The end of the Cold War has also played a role. In Mexico, Claudia Fernandez discovered that the U.S. government was&nbsp;declassifying a large number of documents from the KGB. One&nbsp;should recall that during the Cold War, Mexico City was an&nbsp;important espionage center, a sort of Latin America Vienna.&nbsp;Fernandez used the National Security Archives web page to&nbsp;obtain information sent to Moscow by the Soviet embassy in the&nbsp;1940s and ’50s. She used this information to do a four-part&nbsp;series on Soviet espionage in Mexico, and she described the&nbsp;activities, code names, and even identities of Mexican spies,&nbsp;including artists, writers, and ordinary citizens.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In the business and economic beat, Francisco Vidal navigates for hours each week to find ideas, tips, and hard data to support&nbsp;his reporting. For example, when researching the numerous&nbsp;mergers between large Mexican and multinational firms, he was&nbsp;stonewalled by most executives. On the Internet, however, he&nbsp;has been able to find much of the necessary information, either&nbsp;at the sites of the financial firms that deal with this type of transaction or, ironically, at the pages of some of the very firms that&nbsp;wouldn’t provide information through more traditional channels.</span></p><div>
