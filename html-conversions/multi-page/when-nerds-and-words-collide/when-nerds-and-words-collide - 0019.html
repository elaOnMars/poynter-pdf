<body><h3><a name="bookmark0"></a><span class="font4">The Myth of the Machine</span></h3>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">By Michael J. Berens</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It was the darkest of nights in a windowless room when the source, perched on my desk, quietly delivered a stunning revelation: City police officers owned crack houses. Years later, the&nbsp;source imparted another gem: A serial killer was trolling truck&nbsp;stops in five states for female victims. Most recently, and still&nbsp;going strong after a facelift, my confidant divulged that Chicago&nbsp;nursing homes were secret dumping grounds for violent state&nbsp;psychiatric patients.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">For the last decade, there has been no other exhilarating and exasperating source as my computer, a modern-day Siren whose&nbsp;seductive call leads to journalistic ecstasy - or certain ruin for&nbsp;the unwary.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">We call it computer assisted reporting, CAR for short. There are impressive self-help books and manuals wrapped with&nbsp;sample disks, training classes touting chi squares to regression&nbsp;analysis, self-described gurus who’ve become data gods, and&nbsp;reporters who possess more electronic equipment than common&nbsp;sense. Obscured behind the techno-babble is a simple truth: The&nbsp;best computer assisted reporting is bom from the heart, not the&nbsp;machine.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Critics often charge that CAR represents a barrier to good storytelling. There are no shortages of examples to confirm this&nbsp;fear. Of course, the telephone has been used for bad stories, too;&nbsp;skeptics are not shunning </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">that</span><span class="font3"> journalism tool. The best computer assisted reporting is invisible within the narrative, a hidden&nbsp;backbone that authoritatively supports the story. A random&nbsp;sample of this country’s best journalism will, more often than&nbsp;not, reveal the role of computer assisted research.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It helps to envision the computer as a person, someone with frailties and faults, a woefully naive child who only repeats what&nbsp;it has been told, but possessing an innocence that can spot simple truths. Stories are unlocked by penetrating questions, not by&nbsp;the capacity of the Pentium chip. Vision, intuition, and imagination should combine bits and bytes into words that cause the&nbsp;reader to bolt into anger or shed a tear.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">More than a decade ago, I owned nothing more than a boxy Macintosh Plus and a piece of accounting software, Microsoft&nbsp;Excel. The resulting stories still stand tall today. Vice squad&nbsp;officers who got drunk on duty, juvenile prisoners raped by state&nbsp;guards, police informants who framed innocent citizens - these&nbsp;stories resulted from filling in blanks of little Excel squares, resembling blank graph paper on the screen. It was a&nbsp;valuable lesson: Start simple.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">All I had to do was fill in the blanks. This was something I could understand. And the computer could reorganize the information in ways that seemed, well, magical. I would stare at the&nbsp;information for hours. I looked for patterns and anomalies,&nbsp;sorting and re-sorting to my every whim. Later came the&nbsp;realization that I was interviewing the data just as I would any&nbsp;other source.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do most nursing homes mix young psychiatric patients with elderly residents? Is it normal for police cruisers to crash in half</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">of all high-speed pursuits? How many fugitives are secretly released because police don’t want to pay for extradition?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Following analysis of a court database, I determined that 90 percent of domestic violence cases were eventually dismissed.&nbsp;Some might jump at this lead, trumpet the computer findings,&nbsp;snag a few prosecutor quotes, touch base with victim advocates,&nbsp;and mix it all into an instant story. This would be a CAR failure.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Why were there so many dismissals? Again, ask the computer for clues. Dismissals were typically granted during arraignment&nbsp;hearings, computer analysis showed. Arraignment hearings are&nbsp;held with 24 hours of the crime. What the heck was going on? A&nbsp;visit to the hearings provided the answers: Cases were automatically dismissed if victims could not make it to the hearing, even if&nbsp;they had no transportation or had been hospitalized just hours before. If victims did show, they were required to stand just feet&nbsp;away from their attacker, an intimidating requirement for some&nbsp;women who fled in tears. Some male judges unmercifully grilled&nbsp;female victims who asked for protection orders. Traditional reporting skills still create the outer covering, the contour, and the&nbsp;texture. The resulting human stories were a CAR success.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The myth of the machine hit home in the early 1990s when a Cable News Network crew visited the newsroom to film a&nbsp;segment on how I documented the existence of a possible serial&nbsp;killer. Using a spreadsheet program, I tracked the unsolved&nbsp;deaths of women whose bodies were found along highways. The&nbsp;computer was a significant tool, but breakthroughs occurred&nbsp;through interviews and leaked law enforcement documents.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“How did you do the story?” the producer asked. My answers stressed old-fashioned legwork coupled with the power of the&nbsp;computer. My answer was unsatisfactory. Surely I discovered&nbsp;some sort of technological alchemy; perhaps a complex mathematical formula was employed, no? The producer was sure that I&nbsp;was trying to be modest. “Come on,” she said. “You can tell us&nbsp;how you really did it.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Later, the FBI invited me to Quantico, Va., to explain how my trusty Macintosh outmatched the bureau’s mainframes, which&nbsp;were programmed to spot pattern crimes. It’s not the size of the&nbsp;computer, but the human behind it that matters most, I told a&nbsp;crowd of homicide detectives. “Sounds like it was blind luck,”&nbsp;one agent quipped.</span></p><div><img src="when-nerds-and-words-collide - 0019_files/when-nerds-and-words-collide - 0019-1.jpg" style="width:67pt;height:85pt;"/>
<p><span class="font0">Michael J. Berens is a project reporter for the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Chicago Tribune.</span><span class="font0"> He has been a frequent speaker&nbsp;and trainer for IRE. Computer assisted projects&nbsp;include a secretive state plan to warehouse&nbsp;young psychiatric patients in geriatric nursing&nbsp;homes: a possible serial killer trolling truck stops&nbsp;nationally; the deadly toll of police chases and&nbsp;federal government underreporting; and cops&nbsp;who owned crack houses.</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
<p><span class="font3">Indeed, luck is part of the quotient. For example, I computerized search warrants on a spreadsheet to analyze the success of the crack war. One of the fields - reluctantly included following&nbsp;an editor’s suggestion - designated the time and day of the raid. I</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/>
