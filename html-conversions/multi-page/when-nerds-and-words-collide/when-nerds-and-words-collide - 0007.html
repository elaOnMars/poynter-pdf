<p><span class="font2">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Training for management on how to evaluate CAR skills.</span></p><h4><a name="bookmark0"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Project ideas</span></h4>
<p><span class="font2">In the discussions that followed from this inventory of issues, six priority projects were proposed. These were:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Help the assigning/line editors help us: </span><span class="font2">The most essential person to journalists working on CAR projects is their editor, but&nbsp;too often the editor doesn’t know much about these techniques.&nbsp;An editor can help reporters who are using traditional reporting&nbsp;techniques; an editor knows how to question a journalist who had&nbsp;interviewed a person, but not one who has interviewed data. Editors need some help.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">IDEA: Write a handbook, “What Every Editor Needs to Know About CAR,” focusing not on the technical aspects but&nbsp;the practical questions they should know to ask.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Catalog </span><span class="font2">the </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">resources: </span><span class="font2">Data access is the make or break point for CAR work. Negotiating the acquisition of records, understanding the pitfalls of using the records, developing ideas for&nbsp;reporting from the records, and making access to the information&nbsp;in the records available to other journalists are the challenges. In&nbsp;newsrooms all around the country, journalists have negotiated for&nbsp;records and figured out how to make it easier for others to use them.&nbsp;We’d like to gather information on those records, how much they&nbsp;cost, what was involved in getting them, and how they are being used.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">IDEA: Create a database of databases to which individual newsrooms can contribute. This could be an internal record-</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/>
