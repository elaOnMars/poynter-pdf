<body><h4><a name="bookmark0"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Case study</span></h4>
<p><span class="font2">Newsroom management set forth a vision for the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Mercury News</span><span class="font2"> to be the “voice of Silicon Valley.” That meant that our internal technology literacy needed to be increased. The approach&nbsp;to research and computer assisted reporting tools has come from&nbsp;the newsroom with strong buy-in from the systems editor (a former reporter and editor). The goals early on were to:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Get folks to use those boxes on their desks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evangelize - get folks excited.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Get as many tools as possible into their hands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Get stories into the paper.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">We began with a self-assessment of newsroom skill levels that showed a significant number of newsroom personnel had minimal or no Windows skills.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Our goal was to expose as many people as possible to the tools available through “basic training.” The basics included:&nbsp;Computer Basics/Windows, Microsoft Mail, Introduction to the&nbsp;Internet, Introduction to Excel, and Introduction to Access.&nbsp;Within the first year, about two-thirds of the newsroom had&nbsp;taken at least one class. Once they were trained, it was important&nbsp;to keep their skills shaip, so I conducted a lot of one-on-one&nbsp;training and obtained databases for particular reporters.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Training at the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Mercury News</span><span class="font2"> is not limited to reporters. All staff can benefit from these skills. Copy editors who are&nbsp;exposed to these tools tend to edit CAR stories better. The make-or-break group that needs training is assigning editors: If they&nbsp;support CAR, reporters will use it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">A key move early in the process was to train top management. We offered a weekend “data retreat” where we talked about&nbsp;story ideas and managing CAR, and conducted hands-on training. Other related training includes math brown bag lunches and&nbsp;sessions by our lawyers on legal issues.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">I also learned how important follow-up is to developing CAR skills. Reporters can take classes forever, but until they actually&nbsp;get through the pitfalls of their first project, their skills really&nbsp;never become ingrained.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Mercury News’s</span><span class="font2"> approach to computer assisted reporting is to give reporters the tools and the help they need to use as&nbsp;many of those tools themselves as they can. We don’t have an&nbsp;analysis department that feeds printouts to reporters because we&nbsp;believe analysis is part of the reporting process.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">We’re now reaping the benefits of that approach, because CAR skills are more widespread. At any given time at least 10&nbsp;people are working on some sort of story using CAR tools.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Training, data, and stories all contribute to getting the word out. But repetition never hurts. We developed an irreverent&nbsp;monthly computer assisted reporting newsletter. The newsletter,&nbsp;along with tip sheets, the style guide, and other resources, is on&nbsp;the company intranet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">We also offer frequent brown bag lunches with outside speakers discussing what their organizations are doing with&nbsp;CAR. This helps to get people excited.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Money provides incentive. We give a quarterly cash award for computer assisted reporting. This helps CAR be recognized as&nbsp;an important reporting tool. (And not just because of the money.&nbsp;It also sends the message that if management is willing to give&nbsp;money for good CAR, it must be important.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Acquisition of data was more work on the local level than I had expected. We’ve faced difficult battles with the city of San&nbsp;Jose and other local and state jurisdictions for even the most&nbsp;basic data. We pursued a two-year fight for pet license data in&nbsp;San Jose, which we ended up losing in court. As a result, several&nbsp;news organizations in California have joined forces against&nbsp;some state agencies for data.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">All of our reference databases are on SQL server, accessible via a web browser from all desktops. This data initially was in&nbsp;Access with front-ends, but the system was just too overloaded.&nbsp;SQL server is faster and easier to use. Our reference databases&nbsp;include voter registration, business licenses, campaign finances,&nbsp;and corporations data.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The next step was to work with bureaus and city/county reporters to acquire their own “resource” data. We’ve begun a&nbsp;strong effort in one of our larger, more CAR-savvy bureaus. We&nbsp;hope it will be a model for the rest of the newsroom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">At this point, most folks are able to use the Internet on their own, with help now and then on search techniques. Other tools&nbsp;such as databases and spreadsheets are being used regularly by a&nbsp;core of about 40 people. That number is slowly increasing. More&nbsp;advanced tools such as mapping and statistical programs are&nbsp;beginning to be used by our early adopters.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The key has been to train assigning editors about CAR tools. The reporters who do the most CAR work report to editors who&nbsp;understand the tools. For example, our education editor&nbsp;demanded that all her reporters take classes and won’t hire&nbsp;anyone without basic CAR understanding. She now has several&nbsp;people who regularly use databases. One even uses statistical&nbsp;analyses frequently. (They call him “data boy.”)</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">We’ve tried to avoid the “magic wand syndrome” when folks want to do a complex project very quickly and promise way too&nbsp;much, too fast. As a solution to that, the new projects review&nbsp;process requires that folks check with the database editor before&nbsp;submitting their initial budgets. The database editor is also part&nbsp;of the projects review committee.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">We’ve had some great success stories. A good example is our road transportation reporter, “Mr. Roadshow.” When he first&nbsp;came to training, he’d ask: “OK, so do I turn the computer on&nbsp;now?” Several stories later, he has truly integrated CAR into his&nbsp;beat. When there’s an accident on a particular road, he now&nbsp;checks the accident database to find how often accidents have&nbsp;occurred at that spot. He’s also one of the most positive people&nbsp;in the newsroom and has served as a model for others.</span></p><h4><a name="bookmark1"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Where is computer assisted reporting today?</span></h4>
<p><span class="font2">At the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Mercury News,</span><span class="font2"> CAR is a valued tool for everyone. And although not everyone uses it, most folks think they should be.&nbsp;I’m not sure all newsrooms work that way. I think many newsrooms follow the old model of someone working magic in the&nbsp;corner and providing reporters with results. That does more&nbsp;harm than good. When the great and powerful Oz in the corner&nbsp;leaves for a better job, the newsroom is back to square one.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Ego is a big part of elitist CAR. Some CAR geeks still think most reporters are too stupid to really learn CAR. Good&nbsp;reporters can learn basic CAR skills and make use of them in&nbsp;their reporting. Some complicated tasks, such as data cleaning</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
