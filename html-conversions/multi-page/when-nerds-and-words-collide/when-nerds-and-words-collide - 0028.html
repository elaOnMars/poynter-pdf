<body><h3><a name="bookmark0"></a><span class="font3">The Education of a Computer Assisted Reporter</span></h3>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">By Jim Heaney</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">I was greatly influenced early in my career by Phil Meyer’s book </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Precision Journalism</span><span class="font2"> and its proposition that reporters&nbsp;needed to go beyond traditional reporting methods. Many&nbsp;reporters have been able to act on that vision through the rise of&nbsp;computer assisted reporting, although I don’t feel newspapers&nbsp;have done a particularly good job of seizing the opportunity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">I got my first taste of CAR in 1986 when I covered transportation for </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Orlando Sentinel.</span><span class="font2"> An upcoming referendum was seeking voter approval to establish a regional transportation&nbsp;agency, with taxing power, to build roads. Everyone knew traffic was bad and getting worse, but I wanted to document the&nbsp;problem and determine to what extent the road improvements&nbsp;proposed by the agency would alleviate congestion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">I obtained data that showed the capacity and usage of all the roads that the new agency would have improved. Back then, few&nbsp;newsrooms had personal computers, and the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sentinel</span><span class="font2"> was no&nbsp;exception. I wound up using a PC in the market research department and got the staff to show me how to use the software. After&nbsp;days of inputting, I finally had useful data, which translated into&nbsp;good stories and graphics that otherwise wouldn’t have been&nbsp;possible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Demonstrating how badly congested the road system was didn’t do agency advocates any good - the proposal was&nbsp;trounced in referendum - but the exercise gave me a sense of the&nbsp;possibilities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">I moved to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Buffalo News</span><span class="font2"> later that year and found much the same situation. The market research department, not the&nbsp;newsroom, had the PCs, so I made friends there, doing a variety&nbsp;of stories. I have always liked “compare and contrast” stories,&nbsp;and CAR allowed me to do them with a lot of material at my&nbsp;disposal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In the early 1990s I realized CAR was the wave of the future and set out to do a project that would force me to learn software&nbsp;and all the assorted ins and outs. It was time to cut the cord with&nbsp;the market research people, who had done their share of hand&nbsp;holding.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">I sold my editors on doing a series on slum housing in the city, which required building a database of all the code violators who&nbsp;had been prosecuted in city housing court. There was one&nbsp;problem, however. The courts had just started entering their&nbsp;housing records into a database the year before, and there wasn’t&nbsp;a sufficient record built yet. I shelved my series for a year and a&nbsp;half until there were three years of data.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">With that, my education began. I had to learn software. I learned of the perils of dirty data. I had people wondering what&nbsp;the hell Heaney was doing for all that time, playing with a&nbsp;computer but not producing stories. They soon found out.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">I produced a five-day series that identified the 12 worst slumlords in the city, pinpointed the streets with the worst housing, and detailed the total impotence of the housing court. The power&nbsp;of the series rested in the detail I was able to produce through my&nbsp;computer analysis. I was able to deliver the goods.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The series sold my editors on the promise of CAR, and other reporters at the paper starting following suit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In the mid-1990s I tackled Buffalo’s public school system, taking over the beat and producing an eight-day series assessing&nbsp;the condition of the system. As a part of my reporting, I collaborated with a team of local university professors to build and&nbsp;analyze student demographic and testing data.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">I struggled with the same kinds of issues I did with the slumlord project - having to learn yet another software package, cleaning up dirty data, and, most of all, hying not to be overwhelmed by all the information. I went home with my brain&nbsp;fried more times than I care to remember.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">While I remain the beat reporter, I spend most of my time doing enterprise reporting, and I’ve found over the past couple&nbsp;of years that there are very few major stories for which I’m not&nbsp;tapping into a database or building a spreadsheet. CAR has&nbsp;made me more of a data-driven reporter than I used to be.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">At the same time, I spend a lot of time doing traditional street reporting, dealing with sources, and spending time in the&nbsp;schools. CAR is no substitute for being there, and more than&nbsp;once I have found that the conclusions drawn from my tidy&nbsp;spreadsheets don’t pass the reality test.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">I’ll admit that I’ve blown hot and cold on CAR. Old habits, office politics, pressure to generate stories off my beat, and plain&nbsp;old burnout have proven to be disincentives at times. Having to&nbsp;learn new software (I think I’m on my fourth version) tends to&nbsp;get old, especially when you’re often left to learn it on your own.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Yet I’ve come through the past 12 years convinced that any reporter worth a damn must master CAR techniques. When I&nbsp;speak to college journalism students, that’s usually one of the&nbsp;first points I make: Don’t graduate without learning a lot about&nbsp;using computers. My advice to uninitiated reporters is to find a&nbsp;story that will force them to learn the ropes. It’s easier to wade in&nbsp;through individual stories than to jump headfirst into a major&nbsp;project. I also encourage reporters to attend an Investigative&nbsp;Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference to soak up ideas.</span></p><div><img src="when-nerds-and-words-collide - 0028_files/when-nerds-and-words-collide - 0028-1.jpg" style="width:67pt;height:85pt;"/>
<p><span class="font0">Jim Heaney is data driven enterprise editor for </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Buffalo News.</span><span class="font0"> As an investigative reporter,&nbsp;he focused on urban issues including housing, city&nbsp;government, and education. He worked as a reporter and editor at </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Orlando Sentinel</span><span class="font0"> from&nbsp;1980-86. Heaney has won numerous journalism&nbsp;awards and was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize for&nbsp;investigative reporting in 1993.</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">23</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
<p><span class="font2">I think newspapers have come a fair way in embracing CAR, but not nearly far enough. CAR remains too much of a bottom-up phenomenon, practiced by reporters with initiative and&nbsp;ignored by those without. Newsroom management usually says&nbsp;the right things, but few people in charge have actually done&nbsp;CAR journalism, and their support is too much in the abstract&nbsp;and short of absolute. And it shows in the haphazard way that&nbsp;CAR has been introduced at many newspapers.</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/>
