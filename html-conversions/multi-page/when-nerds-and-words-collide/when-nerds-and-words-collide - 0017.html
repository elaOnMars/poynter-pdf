<body><h3><a name="bookmark0"></a><span class="font5">Put Your Career in the Fast Lane with CAR</span></h3>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">By Paul Adrian</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">I found out about computer assisted reporting (CAR) after being a reporter for half a decade. At the time, I thought I knew a&nbsp;lot about how to do my job, but that changed in 1993 when I&nbsp;learned there was an important reporting skill that I knew next to&nbsp;nothing about. I discovered this at the National Institute of Computer Assisted Reporting’s (NICAR) fust national computer&nbsp;conference in Raleigh, N.C. This may sound like a cliche, but&nbsp;that weekend changed my life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">When I left the conference, I didn’t know exactly how to use a computer for research, but I got a taste of what CAR could add&nbsp;to my reporting. It felt like I had done all my reporting in a 10-by-10-foot room, and then someone walked to a window that I&nbsp;hadn’t noticed, opened it, and said, “You know, you can do&nbsp;stories out here also.” I looked out to find a world I had missed, a&nbsp;world full of stories CAR would help me find.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">What did I learn? Well, let’s start with what I already knew. Every government agency collects information all the time.&nbsp;That’s no big mystery, because every reporter uses information&nbsp;collected and stored by government agencies. We get the&nbsp;information one record at a time, as we need it for stories. With&nbsp;computer assisted reporting, you no longer ask for one record,&nbsp;you ask for every record. “Put it all on a disk,” you can tell an&nbsp;agency, “so I can look at it on my own computer at my own&nbsp;speed.” This gives the reporter the power to do his own research.&nbsp;No longer does he depend on the agency he’s investigating to do&nbsp;the work for him. How many times in your career have you discovered something and wondered, “Is this just a fluke or a widespread problem?” CAR helps you answer that question. It also&nbsp;helps you hold officials’ feet to the fire. When they dismiss your&nbsp;question by saying, “That one just fell through the cracks,” you&nbsp;can come back at them and say, “Actually, we looked at the&nbsp;records and found 46 more examples of the same thing.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">OK, I can hear some of you saying, “Cut the hyperbole. You’re sounding like one of those get-rich-quick guys on an&nbsp;infomercial.” I apologize if I sound that way, but the truth is that&nbsp;computer assisted reporting has been a boon to me. Since&nbsp;starting my computer training, I’ve accepted two full-time&nbsp;investigative reporting jobs, my salary has more than doubled,&nbsp;and most importantly, I’ve produced the best stories of my life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">For me, deciding whether I should learn how to use computers to research stories was a no-brainer. I felt you had to do it. It seemed clear that developing even rudimentary skills would&nbsp;allow a reporter to begin to produce significant stories he&nbsp;couldn’t find in any other way. So, why on earth are there so few&nbsp;television journalists who effectively use computers in their&nbsp;reporting? Here are the reasons I hear all the time, and my&nbsp;response for those of you who may be struggling with these issues in your newsroom.</span></p><h4><a name="bookmark1"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">The excuses</span></h4>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">■ Computer-generated stories don’t make good television stories. </span><span class="font4">I want to do stories about people, not numbers. My</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">response: Don’t blame the computer for bad writing. If you focus on sterile aspects of a story, you’ll get a sterile story. Use&nbsp;the numbers generated by your analysis to build a foundation for&nbsp;your story, but don’t focus on the numbers exclusively.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A lot of times I will boil a mountain of research down to a line or two in the script, but that one line forms the backbone of my&nbsp;story. Then, just like with any other story, I concentrate on storytelling, which means finding people. Since I have thousands of&nbsp;records at my fingertips, I find dramatic examples that I&nbsp;wouldn’t have found without the computer’s help. For instance,&nbsp;I once got pictures of an emergency medical technician with five&nbsp;drunken driving convictions on his record who was driving an&nbsp;ambulance. His employer didn’t know about the driving record&nbsp;that the computer allowed me to find. I found a principal and a&nbsp;teacher working in Ohio schools who had both been previously&nbsp;jailed for sexual assaults on students. I discovered them because&nbsp;the computer could quickly sort through half a million records.&nbsp;For another story, I found a man who got a $300,000 loan from&nbsp;the city even though he owed local government more than&nbsp;$40,000 in property taxes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Using a computer to research stories takes too long. I&nbsp;have to turn a story today. </span><span class="font4">True, doing a computer assisted&nbsp;project can take a long time. But I urge news directors to realize&nbsp;investing time on the front end can mean many payoffs in the&nbsp;long run. I collect data for almost all of the time-consuming&nbsp;projects I work on, but then I keep the data and make it available&nbsp;to the newsroom as a reference tool for quick-turn stories. For&nbsp;example, I once obtained a database of crime reports from the&nbsp;Columbus police department to use on a project. For months&nbsp;after my story aired, we used the database to add context to daily&nbsp;crime stories that the station covered. When a murder happened,&nbsp;we could look at the data and say it happened in a very dangerous neighborhood, much worse than the typical Columbus&nbsp;neighborhood. That way we didn’t needlessly scare viewers&nbsp;with the idea that the whole city was crime infested.</span></p><div><img src="when-nerds-and-words-collide - 0017_files/when-nerds-and-words-collide - 0017-1.jpg" style="width:67pt;height:85pt;"/>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You have to purchase a lot of equipment to do a computer assisted story, and I can’t get my boss to buy me a new&nbsp;pack of pencils, much less a high-powered computer. </span><span class="font4">With&nbsp;the price of computer equipment dropping, cost is not an excuse.&nbsp;You can get a computer for $2,000 today that CAR reporters&nbsp;could only dream about five years ago. So even if you have to&nbsp;buy your own equipment (and initially a lot of CAR reporters&nbsp;did just that), that’s not a good enough excuse to avoid learning&nbsp;these skills. However, any news director who doesn’t equip his</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/>
