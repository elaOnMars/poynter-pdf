<p><span class="font1">and statistical analysis, may not become mainstream for a long time, but basic spreadsheet and database work can be used by&nbsp;the entire newsroom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Some reporters think they are “above” some CAR skills. To some, CAR is not seen as reporting, but rather as a clerical&nbsp;function that doesn’t deserve the credit awarded to traditional&nbsp;reporting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The definition of CAR itself is now somewhat confusing. Frequently, students visiting the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Mercury News</span><span class="font1"> say they do computer assisted reporting. When I ask more about what they do, they usually say they make web pages.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The term computer assisted reporting is confusing in the age of the Internet. Is it data analysis? Is it publishing electronic information? Is it searching the Internet?</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">I usually define computer assisted reporting as analyzing data to do stories that reporters couldn’t do any other way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In some cases, the news organization’s online arm makes better use of databases than the traditional newsroom. There is a&nbsp;disconnect between newsroom staff and online folks in an area&nbsp;where so much potential exists. In some cases, newsroom staff&nbsp;are interested in adding depth to their projects using online&nbsp;resources, but the online side shows little interest. In other cases,&nbsp;the online staff wants to develop in-depth online projects, but the&nbsp;newsroom is not interested in working with them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">There’s no question today that editors know CAR is important. I’m just not sure they always know why. Many newsroom managers still don’t understand enough to know how to&nbsp;evaluate whether someone has the skills.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Some journalists face a lack of understanding by newsroom systems administrators, who put unreasonable restrictions on&nbsp;computer use. Folks in one newsroom were not allowed to use&nbsp;the floppy drives on their computers; others were not given Internet browsers because they might “play” on the Internet. These&nbsp;restrictions are ridiculous. Should we take away reporters’ telephones because they might call a friend, or remove their pencils&nbsp;because they might waste time doodling?</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Overall, we’re not at the level I would have expected 10 years ago. Although newsrooms have significant groups of CAR&nbsp;users, CAR is not widespread. Those who have been pioneers in&nbsp;this field should lead the way to integrate CAR tools to the&nbsp;extent that writing an essay about computer assisted reporting&nbsp;will seem as silly as writing an essay about telephone assisted&nbsp;reporting would seem today.</span></p><div>
