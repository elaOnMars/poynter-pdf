<body><h3><a name="bookmark0"></a><span class="font3">Journalists: Turn Around</span></h3>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">By Stephen C. Miller</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">I started doing computer assisted reporting by accident. I didn’t even know that I was doing a form of CAR until I went to&nbsp;the first NICAR conference in Raleigh, N.C. Of course, I had to&nbsp;twist the definition of CAR to fit what I was doing and not what,&nbsp;at that time, everyone else was still calling “Database Journalism.” I took the words literally: that CAR meant using a computer to assist in reporting. I hadn’t done a big database project or&nbsp;spent weeks crunching numbers to make connections that were&nbsp;not possible before computerization. In fact, when I started doing CAR in 1982,1 was just trying to make enough money as a&nbsp;free-lancer to support my family.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The only way I found to do that was to crank out multiple versions of the same story for different magazines, and the only way to do that was to use a personal computer and CAR techniques. Of course, I was a sort of idiot savant of CAR because I&nbsp;didn’t even know that was what I was doing. I was just making it&nbsp;up as I went along because I had to. And what I was making up&nbsp;was using CAR for daily journalism, not projects.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">I started using my PC to short circuit some time-consuming processes that kept me from writing. I stopped going to the&nbsp;library when I discovered that I could get a cheap version of&nbsp;Dialog through CompuServe. I didn’t know that I was querying&nbsp;a database, I just knew that I could get background information&nbsp;without wasting a couple of hours traveling to the library.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">I learned to use a spreadsheet, not because I saw the journalistic possibilities, but because I was doing a story about&nbsp;this upstart company called Lotus Development and some&nbsp;computer program called 1-2-3 that was exciting to all the&nbsp;accountants.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">I used the spreadsheet for the first time to analyze data because I was online to the Department of Education’s bulletin&nbsp;board service, and they had all these statistics in files that could&nbsp;only be read with a spreadsheet. And once I opened the files, all&nbsp;that stuff I had learned about Lotus 1-2-3 suddenly made sense.&nbsp;When I started looking at the numbers in different ways, I saw&nbsp;that I could sell three more pieces based on just sorting the data.&nbsp;I even figured out that the graphing capabilities of Lotus could&nbsp;help me sell pieces to all those math-phobic editors. They were&nbsp;impressed that I could visualize the data for them and not hit&nbsp;them with a lot of mind-numbing numbers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">I was stunned when I found out that other people were not only using some of the techniques that I had fumbled through,&nbsp;but were using it in a clear, systematic way to do “real” reporting&nbsp;and not the quick knockoffs for a 800-word magazine piece.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">After attending a few conferences, it hit me that there had been a fundamental change in how news was gathered and&nbsp;processed, and it happened while most of us were too busy&nbsp;reacting to breaking news to notice. And, for the first time, the&nbsp;changes were not driven by management’s desire to cut costs&nbsp;with automation. Computers were first put in newsroom not to&nbsp;do better journalism, but to save money by getting rid of the&nbsp;typographers’ union.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In fact, how journalism was altered had nothing at all to do with the news business. It had to do with the development of the&nbsp;personal computer and the sophisticated business programs that&nbsp;run on it such as word processors, spreadsheets, and databases.&nbsp;It also grew from advances in telecommunications - the ability&nbsp;to quickly transmit information over standard phone lines and to&nbsp;be able to interact with millions of computers around the world.&nbsp;And it grew out of some weird, spontaneous desire to put online&nbsp;every scrap of information known to man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Today’s journalist is likely to carry a laptop loaded with a word processor, a communications program, a spreadsheet, a&nbsp;database, and a contact manager. The story will be transmitted&nbsp;from the scene over a cellular telephone or even a portable satellite dish.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">While hardware and software play a big part in altering journalism, the major change is where information resides and&nbsp;how journalists get to it. Online databases and the Internet are&nbsp;vast storehouses of information that reporters and editors can tap&nbsp;into in an instant to add greater depth to stories. Even the nature&nbsp;of interviewing has been altered with the use of electronic mail.&nbsp;I’ve just about eliminated telephone tag by doing most of my&nbsp;interviews via e-mail.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">But most reporters and editors are behind the curve in utilizing all the technology to commit better journalism. One of&nbsp;the reasons is lack of knowledge and training. Training is not a&nbsp;priority in most newsrooms. “Here’s your workstation; press&nbsp;that key to start a new story and, when you’re finished, press that&nbsp;key and it’ll go to your editor.” Young reporters are tossed into&nbsp;the deep end of the pool and are expected to learn the tricks of&nbsp;the trade by osmosis. Even seasoned reporters get stuck in ruts&nbsp;because there is usually no continuing training at their&nbsp;organizations. And of course, there’s denial: “Look, I get a piece&nbsp;in the paper every day. What do I need to learn all this new stuff&nbsp;for?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Another reason for not using the technology is computer phobia. Even in the middle of the “information age” there are&nbsp;still lots of people, in and out of the news business, who are&nbsp;intimidated and frightened by computers. Geekspeak, compu-babble, and TLAs have done nothing to ease anyone’s fear of&nbsp;computers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>1</sup> Three Letter Acronyms. The computer industry loves to compress complex terminology into TLAs - DOS, RAM, ROM, COM, EXE, MHz, BPS, etc. If you're stuck at a party with some alleged computing expert, ask him/her if there a difference between baud rate and bits per second. If they say none, take their advice with a large&nbsp;grain of salt. If you really want to know the difference, look it up online.</span></p><div><img src="when-nerds-and-words-collide - 0038_files/when-nerds-and-words-collide - 0038-1.jpg" style="width:67pt;height:85pt;"/>
