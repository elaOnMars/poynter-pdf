<body><h3><a name="bookmark0"></a><span class="font4">Changes in Attitudes, Changes in Latitudes</span></h3>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">By Brant Houston</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Computer assisted reporting (CAR) has been more of an evolution than a revolution. In the 10 years since the first CAR&nbsp;conference was held and two CAR institutes were started, there&nbsp;have been significant, but sometimes hard to see, changes.&nbsp;Among those changes:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The acceptance of CAR as a integral part not only of&nbsp;projects reporting, but also of daily and beat reporting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A stunning increase in the demand for training seminars.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A substantial growth in the number of journalists using&nbsp;these techniques.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The development of a generally accepted curriculum and&nbsp;syllabus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spread of CAR to other countries, particularly in Scandinavia and Central and South America.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">While there continue to be doubts and fears among veteran journalists about the use of CAR, the resistance is weakening to&nbsp;software that allows a journalist to give depth and context to&nbsp;daily, beat, and project stories. Furthermore, the speed of&nbsp;reporting has increased with the advent of the World Wide Web,&nbsp;software that’s easier to use, and the availability of more databases online.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">But rather than dwell on generalities, I will use the National Institute for Computer Assisted Reporting (NICAR) as an example and mirror of the overall changes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Missouri School of Journalism and CAR pioneer Elliot Jaspin created the institute in 1989. At that time, the institute&nbsp;was named the Missouri Institute for Computer Assisted Reporting (MICAR).</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jaspin had built a national reputation for himself while at the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Providence Journal-Bulletin</span><span class="font3"> by learning to download and&nbsp;analyze information on computer tapes. Although he had won a&nbsp;Pulitzer Prize while he worked for a Pennsylvania daily years&nbsp;earlier, Jaspin had won no major awards for his CAR work. Yet&nbsp;magazine articles about the stories he culled from his data analysis attracted the attention of other investigative journalists.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Although Jaspin did not use traditional social science research methods (unlike another database reporting pioneer, Philip&nbsp;Meyer), his counting, summing, and comparing of information&nbsp;in databases resulted in hard-hitting exposes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In addition to showing by example, Jaspin made a critical contribution while on a Freedom Forum Fellowship. On leave&nbsp;from the Providence paper, Jaspin teamed with a computer programmer, Daniel Woods, to develop software called 9-Track&nbsp;Express, which was a major technical breakthrough because it&nbsp;gave journalists an easier way to get information off computer&nbsp;tapes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">That innovation freed journalists from learning the more complex programming language required by mainframe computers and from having to find time and space on mainframes that were&nbsp;being primarily used at newspapers for payroll, advertising,&nbsp;marketing, and circulation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">When Jaspin arrived at the University of Missouri, he quickly</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">put together a series of one-week seminars for journalists eager to learn how to download data and analyze databases. Most of&nbsp;the journalists who came to Missouri were veteran investigative&nbsp;reporters who had been doing databases in hard copy - that is,&nbsp;creating and sorting index cards, looking for connections&nbsp;between campaign contributions and government contracts,&nbsp;searching through libraries and documents for patterns of waste,&nbsp;fraud, or racial disparity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jaspin also began teaching a class in computer assisted reporting at Missouri and had graduate students write a newsletter, called </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Uplink,</span><span class="font3"> and create a database library that collected and&nbsp;distributed useful government databases.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The seminars, known as “boot camps,” generally had eight to 12 journalists or system administrators. The boot camps included&nbsp;lessons and lectures on computer tape downloading, database&nbsp;analysis using Structured Query Language, and understanding&nbsp;the roots of data, including how 0’s and 1 ’s combined to create&nbsp;the characters and numbers on a computer screen.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The boot camps were intellectually tough and sometimes frustrating for journalists who had little or no training in computer programming. But many of those who attended became&nbsp;the second wave of CAR pioneers. The successful boot campers&nbsp;returned to newsrooms, argued for hardware and software,&nbsp;produced in-depth stories, and set up training programs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Because Investigative Reporters and Editors Inc., a professional organization begun in 1975, had its offices just down the hall and because many new CAR journalists were IRE&nbsp;members, a natural association formed between MICAR and&nbsp;IRE. And when Jaspin left Missouri in 1992 because of a serious&nbsp;illness in his family, it was not surprising that the IRE executive&nbsp;director, Andy Scott, and other volunteers kept the seminars&nbsp;going while Missouri searched for a replacement.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Meanwhile, IRE board member Bill Dedman set out to obtain a grant for computer assisted reporting that would permit the seminars given at Missouri to be taken to other locations. In 1993,&nbsp;Dedman won a $225,000 grant for IRE from the Freedom Forum&nbsp;to take the seminars on the road. At the same time, IRE and the&nbsp;Missouri School of Journalism worked out an agreement that&nbsp;would make the institute a joint program of the school and IRE.</span></p><div><img src="when-nerds-and-words-collide - 0011_files/when-nerds-and-words-collide - 0011-1.jpg" style="width:67pt;height:85pt;"/>
<p><span class="font0">Brant Houston is executive director of IRE and an assistant professor at the University of&nbsp;Missouri School of Journalism. He was previously managing director of NICAR. A daily&nbsp;journalist for 17 years, he worked at </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Hartford Courant, The Kansas City Star,</span><span class="font0"> and several&nbsp;news organizations in the Boston area.</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
<p><span class="font3">In late 1993, IRE hired me as the managing director of the yet-unnamed institute, and in early 1994 several pieces of the&nbsp;program came together. After I arrived, I persuaded everyone to&nbsp;call the institute the National Institute for Computer Assisted&nbsp;Reporting (NICAR), so we could have a letterhead and have</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/>
