<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Help the J-schools: </span><span class="font2">Integrating CAR skills into traditional journalism training has been a challenge. Should journalism&nbsp;educators have elements of it in all classes, or give one class and&nbsp;hope the students apply those skills in other reporting/writing&nbsp;courses? Journalism educators have tried various approaches.&nbsp;What is working? What suggestions might there be for educators?</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">IDEA: Develop some sample syllabi for journalism courses that incorporate CAR skills within the journalism curriculum.&nbsp;Also, canvass the journalism schools and find out their current&nbsp;CAR curriculum approaches as a way to provide some ideas and&nbsp;contacts to others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Elevate numeracy: </span><span class="font2">Numbers and understanding what they mean are the crux of CAR work. Too many journalists are math-phobic and uncertain in their interpretation of the significance of&nbsp;numerical data or how to do certain types of calculations. We&nbsp;need to help improve their competence and confidence in this&nbsp;critical area of journalistic work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">IDEA: Create a math/spreadsheet competency self-test (along with a pre-test tutorial and clear explanation sheet for how to&nbsp;work the problems for self-evaluation).</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Skills assessment: </span><span class="font2">Just what comprises the suite of CAR skills? What techniques are involved? What processes are required for different techniques? How can journalists’ skill levels&nbsp;be evaluated, and how can they set their own learning goals? We&nbsp;need a skills assessment inventory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">IDEA: Develop a list of CAR competencies that naturally build on each other and develop tests that can help determine&nbsp;skill levels reached after appropriate training.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Who’s doing what we should be doing and how did they do it? </span><span class="font2">Various models and approaches have been taken for the&nbsp;use of CAR in newsrooms, from the “geek in the comer” to the&nbsp;“arm everyone who can shoot.” What approaches have been effective in newsrooms wanting to move CAR use forward, and&nbsp;why have they been effective?</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">IDEA: Analyze the CAR operations in a variety of newsrooms to discover approaches taken, attitudes and perceptions held, and support given. These case studies can be used to help&nbsp;other newsrooms develop approaches to improving the access to&nbsp;and use of CAR techniques in their reporting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The continuing efforts of the conference participants and, we hope, others will bring each of these projects to life.</span></p><h4><a name="bookmark0"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">About this book</span></h4>
<p><span class="font2">This book of readings, a set of CAR autobiographies, is the work of the participants in the January conference. They were&nbsp;asked to write about their place in the evolution of CAR in their&nbsp;organizations and in their work as journalists. In this collection&nbsp;you will find their definitions of CAR, reminiscences of their&nbsp;discovery of CAR, recollections of favorite “How I got ’em”&nbsp;CAR stories, and hard-earned advice to beginners and seasoned&nbsp;journalists venturing into the use of these ways of reporting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">We start the essays with an appropriate chronicler of where CAR has been and where it is going - appropriate because, in&nbsp;many ways, CAR started with him. Phil Meyer, author of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Precision Journalism</span><span class="font2"> and champion of the use of social science research techniques in reporting, begins the set of readings with a&nbsp;typically provocative essay, “The Future of CAR: Declare Victory and Get Out!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Next come essays by the people most involved in three of the foundations of CAR training and discussion: Brant Houston on&nbsp;NIC AR, Jim Brown on NIAR, and Elliot Parker on CARR-L.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">These are followed by personal histories by CAR pioneers and current practitioners who attended the conference. Essays&nbsp;from our three international participants, representing the CAR&nbsp;perspectives in Mexico, Denmark, and the Netherlands are next.&nbsp;Wrapping up are a trio of essays focusing on the CAR education&nbsp;and training needs of the past, present, and future.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">We hope these essays will give you a sense of where CAR has been, how it got to where it is, and what it needs to keep it going.&nbsp;We’d like you to join us in this effort to better understand and&nbsp;promote the techniques of computer assisted reporting into&nbsp;daily and project journalism. Join the CARR-L or NICAR-L list-servs to be part of the discussion. Attend NICAR and IRE conferences. We will be presenting the ideas and issues that came out of&nbsp;this conference in a variety of ways and asking for your input.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In 1991 Larry Sanders, then CAR editor at </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">USA Today,</span><span class="font2"> said, “It won’t be long before some government agencies will not be&nbsp;keeping paper data anymore. If newspapers are going to maintain their ‘watchdog-of-the-govemment’ role, they are going to&nbsp;eventually have to have access to electronic data as well as paper&nbsp;data.” That day has come.</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">3</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
<p><span class="font2">An popular axiom about CAR is that it makes a good reporter better but it won’t make a bad reporter good. It’s not a magic&nbsp;bullet; it’s hard work. But it is work that can find and tell stories&nbsp;that you couldn’t find and tell otherwise.</span></p>
