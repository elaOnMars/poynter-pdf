<p><span class="font1">I believe CAR should be introduced in newsrooms in a very methodical, systematic way. Beats should be retrofit to incorporate CAR resources and techniques. Staff should receive all the&nbsp;necessary equipment and training. Staffing needs to be reconfigured. Editors have to gain a genuine appreciation of the potential&nbsp;of CAR and then hold reporters accountable for changing the&nbsp;way they do their jobs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">I see some papers doing a decent job of this in some ways, but I don’t get the sense that anyone is doing CAR the way it ought&nbsp;to be done.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">There’s a lot of CAR reporting done on projects and other non-deadline work, but I don’t see it woven into daily coverage&nbsp;to the extent it should. I think we’ve come up particularly short&nbsp;when it comes to using CAR to help put stories in context, particularly when it comes to crime. And be it daily or enterprise, I&nbsp;don’t think we’ve been especially inventive when it comes to&nbsp;story ideas.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In short, we’re light years behind a lot of industries when it comes to applying technology, and while we’re making up&nbsp;ground, the pace isn’t quick enough.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">I think a couple of groups, The Poynter Institute and especially IRE, have done much to spread the word. I envision a larger role for them in the future, if they are so inclined.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Too many reporters, too many papers, are trying to figure this out on their own. We need a collaborative effort to accelerate the&nbsp;mainstreaming of CAR. I’d like to see a core of experienced&nbsp;CAR practitioners, working under the flag of IRE, Poynter, or&nbsp;whomever, to work together to advance the cause in different&nbsp;ways than what’s been attempted to this point.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">I’d start by identifying the major beats that all newspapers cover and retrofitting them using CAR resources and techniques. I would develop a model that any newspaper, any reporter, could&nbsp;plug in to. What are the best online resources available? What</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">sort of data are available from agencies and trade groups? Which listservs are worth joining? What are the obvious story ideas that&nbsp;can be pursued to get started? What sort of routines should a reporter get into? What sort of software should they know?</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">With this framework developed, individual reporters could customize their approach to the particulars of their situation. A&nbsp;transportation reporter in a city with a hub airport, for example,&nbsp;might want to focus more on aviation resources than someone&nbsp;dealing primaril) with congested roadways.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">I would take this a step further by having a central clearinghouse that would collect and analyze data that would be shared via an intranet with participating beat reporters to localize. An&nbsp;analysis of aviation safety records at large airports, for example,&nbsp;could generate dozens of local stories. But someone needs to be&nbsp;driving the process. This effort could start out small, with a core&nbsp;of newspapers piloting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">By doing this, CAR proponents could do more than just evangelize and convert one reporter at a time. They could expedite a more sweeping embrace of CAR in newsrooms, and they could&nbsp;influence what gets covered and how. Many of us grumble about&nbsp;the unhealthy influence of coiporate ownership. I see this as a&nbsp;way of constructively steering the ship closer to its appropriate&nbsp;course.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">I think we collectively have enough experience to do some of the things I’ve suggested. Newsroom management has bought&nbsp;into the CAR concept, so that part of the challenge is behind us.</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">24</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
<p><span class="font1">The challenge we face as we move forward is incorporating CAR in a more systematic and intelligent way. As an industiy,&nbsp;we’re not as good as we could, or should, be and I think CAR is&nbsp;our best realistic hope for improvement. Those in the front lines&nbsp;need to devise ways of imbedding the practice throughout our&nbsp;newsrooms. We need to broaden our strategy for accomplishing&nbsp;that.</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
