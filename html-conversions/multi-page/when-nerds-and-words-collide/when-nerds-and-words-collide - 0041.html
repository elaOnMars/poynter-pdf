<p><span class="font2">federal taxpayers the cost of the S&amp;L bailout. To pull off the project, we needed data on the original book value of assets held&nbsp;at the time any given S&amp;L went into bankruptcy; the reassessed&nbsp;value placed on the assets upon acquisition by the RTC; a sale&nbsp;price for any assets sold; and the names of the purchasers. As a&nbsp;starting point, we set up a meeting to interview the RTC’s director about what data he had and how it was kept.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">At that initial meeting Bob and I were told that no database existed. Depending upon one’s point of view that was technically the truth. While the centralized database was under construction,&nbsp;there were four regional databases at the time of our interview,&nbsp;not one national database of assets. Following that frustrating&nbsp;meeting we found a source within the agency who brought us up&nbsp;to speed, and armed with the proper terminology we were able to&nbsp;construct what we thought was an ironclad Freedom of Information request.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Nine months later we were informed that our request had been filled, and the next thing we knew, we were the proud&nbsp;owners of roughly 45,000 pieces of paper. The RTC had simply&nbsp;dumped the contents of all four regional computers, which satisfied the requirements of federal FOIA to provide us with “the&nbsp;record.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Rekeying that data into a usable database cost the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Los Angeles Times</span><span class="font2"> roughly $20,000, and I doubt seriously whether any other&nbsp;news organization would have bothered. I doubt seriously&nbsp;whether the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font2"> would do so today.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Armed with the data, we began to examine the quality of information we had been given. It was readily apparent that&nbsp;roughly one-quarter of the information required for the analysis&nbsp;was missing - some properties lacked an original book value,&nbsp;while others lacked a reassessed value, while still others lacked&nbsp;a sale price. Some properties lacked all three values. Given that&nbsp;the outcome of the study might be embarrassing or even politically damaging to the RTC, we decided that at least half the&nbsp;missing data had to be retrieved before we could proceed. Over&nbsp;the next month, the paper spent roughly $</span><span class="font1">10,000</span><span class="font2"> on property&nbsp;searches throughout the country. Once we knocked the missing&nbsp;data down to no more than </span><span class="font1">10</span><span class="font2"> percent in any region, we proceeded with the analysis.</span></p><h4><a name="bookmark0"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Realize that data require a closer look</span></h4>
<p><span class="font2">During the final analysis of RTC records, which prompted a GAO investigation and ultimately led to a $40 billion reduction&nbsp;in one of the RTC’s funding requests, we discovered that the&nbsp;agency’s bookkeeping methods made it appear as though it were&nbsp;recouping substantially more of the bailout costs than was&nbsp;actually the case.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">To facilitate the sale of less desirable property, the agency had begun bundling one or more quality assets together with properties it could not give away under normal circumstances. While&nbsp;10 properties might collectively sell for $500,000, nine might be&nbsp;nearly worthless. The RTC would then put the $500,000 sale&nbsp;price on each of the individual properties included in the bundle&nbsp;without notation, making it look to the casual observer as though&nbsp;the total purchase price of the bundle was $5 million. Once we&nbsp;caught on to the bookkeeping shuffle, the agency’s performance&nbsp;looked far less rosy.</span></p><h4><a name="bookmark1"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Where possible, live with your data</span></h4>
<p><span class="font2">This is a luxury that few journalists can afford, particularly those at small newspapers or local television stations where they&nbsp;are asked to become experts in a day and allowed to focus on&nbsp;any one subject for a few days at most. Having said that, there is&nbsp;no substitute for getting to know every quirk in the data you&nbsp;have opted to analyze.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Upon deciding to leave the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Los Angeles Times</span><span class="font2"> to form our own consulting company in January 1996, my partner and I&nbsp;made a conscious decision to abandon temporarily any data-based work that did not in some way touch upon our expertise in&nbsp;covering campaigns. Having steeped ourselves in federal contribution data for six years, we knew we were in a unique position&nbsp;to spot trends others might not see.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The first such trend led our old employer to break a series of stories detailing the Democratic National Committee’s acceptance of foreign contributions and other questionable fundraising practices. It arose because we suddenly began seeing&nbsp;dozens of first-time soft money contributors and took the time to&nbsp;discover that at least one, Cheong Am America Inc., had no base&nbsp;of operations within the United States. While that first story was&nbsp;buried deep inside a Saturday edition, the series it spawned&nbsp;eventually won an IRE prize.</span></p><h4><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Develop an analysis plan, even if you change it</span></h4>
<p><span class="font2">Every data analysis should begin with a story idea or hypothesis. Whenever possible, that hypothesis should grow from initial reporting. Only then should one look for data to sharpen the&nbsp;story’s focus - to prove or disprove the hypothesis in social science terms. Fishing expeditions are, in my experience, a complete&nbsp;waste of time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Do not assume you have been given the data you requested. While that sounds absurd, running a few simple checks on the&nbsp;data can save you the embarrassment of labeling your city the&nbsp;violent crime capital of the world when the database you are&nbsp;analyzing does not include Washington, D.C., and several other&nbsp;major metropolitan areas.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Develop rules for double checking information - including anything you enter into the database. With the RTC project we&nbsp;began by double checking the accuracy of any sale in which the&nbsp;assessed market value was either </span><span class="font1">10</span><span class="font2"> times greater or </span><span class="font1">10</span><span class="font2"> times&nbsp;smaller than the sale price. That simple rule led us to uncover the&nbsp;suspect bookkeeping procedures, which led us to check the&nbsp;validity of all data pertaining to bundled sales.</span></p><h4><a name="bookmark3"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Further education can be your friend</span></h4>
<p><span class="font2">Many editors will recognize the need for some form of technical training, but unfortunately most will interpret that to&nbsp;be an exercise in producing greater hardware and software&nbsp;proficiency. If your ultimate goal is to produce journalism that&nbsp;extends beyond the generation of ranked lists, you should seriously consider enrolling in a basic statistics course. If nothing&nbsp;else, it is important to know the difference between a mean, a&nbsp;median, and a mode and proper times to use each such measurement of the “average.” If data-based journalism is to take the&nbsp;next leap forward, it will be on the backs of reporters and editors&nbsp;who understand numbers.</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
