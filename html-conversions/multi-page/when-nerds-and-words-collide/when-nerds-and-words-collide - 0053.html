<p><span class="font2">the attention of a significant number of journalism educators.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">That year, I organized the online exploration notes I had been taking, teamed up with Dr. Elliot King of Loyola College in Baltimore, and sold a book proposal for what became </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Online&nbsp;Journalist,</span><span class="font2"> published by Harcourt Brace College Publishers.&nbsp;The book landed on college campuses late in 1994 and was followed by contracts for three other books having to do with using&nbsp;the Internet to do research. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Online Journalist</span><span class="font2"> has been translated into four other languages and is scheduled for release of a&nbsp;third English language edition in the fall of 1999.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">During the AEJMC national convention in Atlanta in 1995,1 secured use of computer labs at Georgia State, three blocks from&nbsp;the convention hotel. For three days, we ran hands-on sessions on&nbsp;spreadsheets, database software, e-mail, and Internet 101. The&nbsp;same year I began doing a number of training sessions, panel appearances, and seminars that took me into newsrooms and conferences on two continents. I have since worked not only with&nbsp;AEJMC but also with several other educational organizations,&nbsp;professional journalism groups, and various news companies.</span></p><h4><a name="bookmark0"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Where we’ve come</span></h4>
<p><span class="font2">I recognized quickly the value of Internet resources for doing news background work and for reference. Until January 1994,1&nbsp;wasn’t sure the Internet was mature enough to be useful for&nbsp;research on breaking news. The Northridge, Calif., earthquake&nbsp;of Jan. 17, 1994, changed that. The California Office of Emergency Services ran a bulletin board that was accessible by&nbsp;Telnet. Within an hour of the 4:30 a.m. quake, it had posted a&nbsp;notice that confirmed the presence of a serious temblor. OES&nbsp;promised in its notice that it would be posting frequent updates.&nbsp;OES officials made good on that promise, listing road closures,&nbsp;reports of damages, fires, gas leaks, toxic spills, aftershocks,&nbsp;injuries, and deaths. As efforts to deal with the quake aftermath&nbsp;progressed, the OES bulletin board earned reports of relief and&nbsp;rescue operations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Many people in the quake area clamored onto the Internet to post their observations to Usenet news groups, e-mail discussion&nbsp;lists, and to engage in real-time discussion on Internet Relay&nbsp;Chat channels. News people in the Los Angeles area created one&nbsp;of those channels as a public service and a newsgathering tool.&nbsp;And, of course, all the timeless data about earthquakes, including lists of the largest and most destructive quakes, were already&nbsp;archived and available at several sites. Information obtainable&nbsp;during the hours following the Northridge quake convinced me&nbsp;that the Internet could be a valuable research tool for breaking&nbsp;news. All this occurred before the big explosion of interest in the</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">World Wide Web that has brought so many resources and so many journalists onto the Internet.</span></p><h4><a name="bookmark1"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Progress yet to come</span></h4>
<p><span class="font2">A lot has changed since then. Today journalists no longer ask, “What is the Internet?’’ Most know how to use e-mail, and they&nbsp;have had some experience with browsing software. Many have&nbsp;used Internet resources for doing story research. Today, journalists ask two questions most often. They want to know how to find&nbsp;information they seek quickly, and they want to know how they&nbsp;can measure the credibility of information found online. These&nbsp;two questions will continue for the near future to be important in&nbsp;the newsgathering business. Other questions of importance in the&nbsp;near future will address rights to story content, pressures to be&nbsp;first with a stoiy, ethical limits on collaboration, and how best to&nbsp;use this new medium.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Questions of stoiy content rights have risen on at least two levels. On one level are sites that attract Internet readers, in part,&nbsp;by offering content prepared by news organizations. In this situation, the site uses news stories from the websites of news organizations. In extreme cases, these folks serve the content within&nbsp;frames that are surrounded by other frames containing advertising for which the pirate site collects revenue. On another level,&nbsp;some reporters and free-lance writers have complained that they&nbsp;should receive additional compensation when stories prepared&nbsp;for print are republished on the web.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In the second arena, journalists have long dealt with the tension between competition to be first and the need to get the&nbsp;story right. With online publishing, traditional news cycles give&nbsp;way to constant deadlines. The traditional tension between these&nbsp;two forces will continue to beg resolution.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Through e-mail discussion lists and Usenet news groups, journalists from different news organizations are able to collaborate with one another. Each day, they share information on how&nbsp;to develop certain kinds of news stories, what kinds of sources&nbsp;to use on a particular story, and even tips on dealing with government agencies. In former days it was a professional taboo for&nbsp;journalists representing competing news agencies to share&nbsp;notes. Traditional geographical lines no longer define competition. Online forums by their nature are open, and any information shared is freely available globally. News people of the future will have to resolve issues that surround collaboration.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Finally, it is clear that in an interactive environment, individual audience members actually play a part in shaping each story. Clearly, this new medium with new capabilities will demand&nbsp;new writing, researching, and packaging skills.</span></p><div>
