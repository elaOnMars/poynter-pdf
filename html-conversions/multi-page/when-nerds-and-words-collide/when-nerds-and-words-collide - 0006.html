<p><span class="font1">By Nora Paul</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">1989 was a watershed year for journalism. During the 1980s. the power of personal computers increased and the cost&nbsp;dropped. More and more government records were being shifted&nbsp;from paper to electronic fonnat. The message of Phil Meyer’s&nbsp;classic text. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Precision Journalism,</span><span class="font1"> reached an audience of talented journalists who wanted to incorporate its promise of enterprise journalism and analysis into their reporting. These threads&nbsp;came together in 1989 with the establishment of two different&nbsp;organizations, organizations that would change many journalists’ perceptions from the computer as a word processor to the&nbsp;computer as a partner on their reporting team.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In Indianapolis, Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Andy Schneider joined the faculty of Indiana University School of Journalism and soon found a kindred spirit in Jim Brown. Together&nbsp;they conceived a way to begin spreading the word more broadly&nbsp;about the techniques of computer use in reporting. They named it&nbsp;the National Institute for Advanced Reporting (NIAR) and began&nbsp;making plans for the first conference to teach and discuss these&nbsp;techniques. (See Jim Brown's essay on page 8 for more details&nbsp;about the foundation of NIAR and the first conference.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">At the University of Missouri, Elliot Jaspin created the Missouri Institute for Computer Assisted Reporting (MICAR), which held computer “boot camps” for journalists who wanted&nbsp;to be indoctrinated in the techniques of computer use in reporting. (See Brant Houston’s essay on page 6 for more details about&nbsp;the foundation of MICAR and its evolution to the National Institute for Computer Assisted Reporting, orNICAR.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">One of the key developments that brought the potential of data analysis to reporters also was rolled out that year by Jaspin.&nbsp;With project partner Dan Woods, Jaspin created 9-Track Express, a way to use personal computers to manage the huge data&nbsp;files government agencies put onto 9-track tapes that previously&nbsp;had required mainframe computers to process.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Through these training initiatives, grassroots industry buzz about CAR, and some high-profile, prize-winning stories that&nbsp;relied on computer analysis techniques, the dawn of the computer age in newsrooms seemed sunny and assured.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">But 10 years later, just what is the state of computer assisted reporting in newsrooms in the United States and around the&nbsp;world? According to a gathering at Poynter in January 1999.&nbsp;there is some good news and some bad news. Gains in the equipment (case of use, lowered cost, better software) have been&nbsp;weighed down by over-extended journalists who see using this&nbsp;suite of skills as a burden, rather than as a reporting opportunity.&nbsp;While it is true that CAR over the past 10 years has come to be&nbsp;seen as a way to do stories that couldn’t be done otherwise and&nbsp;helps fulfill the journalist's watchdog role, it is also true that&nbsp;these techniques can be hard work (from data acquisition to&nbsp;analysis), that they arc currently underutilized, and that many reporters still want to do things the “easy” way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">What can be done to help promote the use of computer analysis of data to reveal new stories, to verity (or nullify) popular</span></p><img src="when-nerds-and-words-collide - 0006_files/when-nerds-and-words-collide - 0006-1.jpg" style="width:121pt;height:156pt;"/>
<p><span class="font0">Nora Paul is a faculty member at The Poynter Institute for Media Studies and conducts seminars in the areas of news research and news&nbsp;library management. computer assisted&nbsp;reporting. and leadership in new media newsrooms. She came to Poynter in 1991 after 1? years&nbsp;at </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Miami Herald.</span><span class="font0"> She is a frequent speaker at&nbsp;journalism conferences and cofxlucts newsroom&nbsp;workshops and Internet training courses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">conceptions, and to provide the information checks and balances in an increasingly data-based world? The Poynter Institute,&nbsp;NTAR, and N1CAR wanted to know.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Together we decided to convene a group of 22 pioneers and practitioners of CAR techniques. They came to Poynter and, for&nbsp;two and a half days, discussed how CAR has changed the face of&nbsp;journalism and how it hasn’t. After establishing the continuum&nbsp;of CAR techniques - from use of e-mail, to searching online&nbsp;archives, to using the Internet, to use of spreadsheets, to developing databases, to social science research techniques - we all&nbsp;agreed that the battle line for CAR use was drawn at the level of&nbsp;spreadsheet use and above. E-mail, online archive use, and the&nbsp;Internet were, for a majority of journalists, a standard set of tools&nbsp;they used. It was these other tools of computer use in reporting&nbsp;that we wanted to assess.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">We asked the group to help us identify the issues that continue to challenge journalists interested in using these techniques in&nbsp;their reporting and newsgathering. We had them advise us on the&nbsp;kinds of research projects we should undertake that could help&nbsp;the industry understand the impact of CAR work on journalism.&nbsp;Wc challenged them to identify the tools, resources, or guidelines journalists still need that can help them use these techniques with more confidence and ease. Here are some of the&nbsp;highlights:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Issues</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The issue areas identified by the group fell into five broad categories with specific concerns under each:</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Skills/professionalization</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deciding whether CAR/numeracy should be a job requirement for journalists and at what level.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Establishing our identity as a profession.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Putting CAR skills/numeracy on entry-level skills tests and&nbsp;regular performance reviews.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Defining what wc do in terms of objectives instead of tools,&nbsp;clarifying the vision of CAR, and figuring out how to brand and&nbsp;sell it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Promoting social science principles into the daily practice&nbsp;of journalism.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Creating a well-described set of skills for doing CAR and&nbsp;developing industry standards regarding technology skills and&nbsp;knowledge.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Developing a full tool box of reporting skills that integrate&nbsp;CAR with other skills (social science, traditional reporting, civic</span></p>
