<body><h3><a name="bookmark0"></a><span class="font4">On the Road to Digital Journalism</span></h3>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">By Peter J. Verwey</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">I remember very well the technology that was used the first time I entered a newsroom. Newspapers were still situated in the&nbsp;center of the city, and the editor in chief wrote the editorial with&nbsp;his fountain pen. It was by accident that I entered the newsroom&nbsp;of that local newspaper, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">De Gelderlander,</span><span class="font3"> in the city of&nbsp;Nijmegen. As a student, in need of money, I was employed on a&nbsp;temporary basis as a proofreader. The technology was of childish simplicity; as proofreader, I used a red pencil. It wasn’t much&nbsp;better in the newsroom. The ultimate technology was the&nbsp;message system of wind-mail, an ancient forerunner of e-mail&nbsp;based on ah<sup>-</sup> pressure that made it possible to send a message&nbsp;through pipelines from newsroom to printshop.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">When I now enter newsrooms, not only of the national newspapers but also the remotest regional and local newspapers,&nbsp;they are filled with high information technology: computers,&nbsp;networks, Internet and intranets, and the most advanced software.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The first thing one can conclude from this development is that the demands on journalists have became much greater in recent&nbsp;years. Of course the old techniques and skills are still important&nbsp;and very useful. Every journalist must always possess some&nbsp;curiosity, know how to tell a story, and so on. But journalists&nbsp;now also need to know how to handle modem information technology. “Hard-nosed reporting, cultivation of sources, and public records searches may have once amounted to sufficient journalistic skills. But today, in the face of a rapidly growing Internet, journalists need training in new media” says Neda Raouf in&nbsp;“Cross-training Journalists,” </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Online Journalism Review</span><span class="font3">, Nov.&nbsp;11,1998.'</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Skills in these media range from simple word-processing, handling digital images, and editing on screen, to retrieving the&nbsp;latest unemployment figures from the Internet, and calculating&nbsp;key figures about unemployment in spreadsheets. These new&nbsp;demands on journalists are not only in searching for news. The&nbsp;digital revolution also has influenced publishing; the Internet is&nbsp;sometimes called the “fourth medium.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Therefore journalists must also know how to handle text on the Internet: the basics of html are as important as copy markup&nbsp;language for letterpress printing. Writing has evolved from a&nbsp;linear process to a multi-dimensional one. And interactivity,&nbsp;two-way communication with readers, is an important characteristic.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The fourth medium, however, is more than shovelware; it integrates sound and video. Newspaper journalists have no&nbsp;experience with these techniques, and TV journalists have little&nbsp;experience writing articles. “We learned a lot, but still we have a&nbsp;long way to go,” says Theo Stielstra, editor in chief of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">de Volk-skrant online.</span><span class="font3"> “Our online edition is still close to the hardcopy&nbsp;edition, and the number of journalists who use sources on the&nbsp;Internet is limited; this will change in the coming months when&nbsp;the complete newsroom is online.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Wp://www.ojr.org/indexf,htm?/sections/features/98_stories/stories_training.htm</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">As an educator, my first question is: How do we prepare students for this new situation? They are the workers of tomorrow, so they must be trained in latest skills. They must know the&nbsp;state of the art in detail.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">My second question is: How do you train journalists so they can work with this new technology?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Finally: In what context will journalists be working? What changes in communications could take place?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In 1989 I was teaching several international classes about politics of European Union (EU) and European reporting. My&nbsp;search for the latest press releases of the European Commission&nbsp;brought me by coincidence to the Internet. One of the data&nbsp;networks I accessed to the press database of the EU offered a&nbsp;gateway to the Internet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">I was very pleased to discover that I could send mail and files to persons at the other side of the pond. Of course, the CompuServe I used at the time was more user-friendly, but this Internet&nbsp;connection had new, unexpected possibilities. My Dutch colleagues were impressed when I told them how I got the latest information about the U.S. Social Security system. I left a message at the CARR-L discussion list, and within the hour received&nbsp;the address of the Gopher of the SSA.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Still, my colleagues were not seduced by the new technology. “Too difficult for day-to-day practice,” they said. After graphic&nbsp;Internet browsers were introduced in 1993, they changed their&nbsp;opinions. Now they are all on the grid and use it for lectures and&nbsp;training.</span></p><h4><a name="bookmark1"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Education of journalism students</span></h4>
<p><span class="font3">The situation on the European continent differs from the Anglo-Saxon ways of journalism education. In the Netherlands, journalism is not taught at universities but in professional&nbsp;schools. In theory the difference is big. But from my experience,&nbsp;based on teaching in the United States, United Kingdom, and&nbsp;South Africa, I learned that in practice we are close, and agree&nbsp;quite often on standards for education and amount of practical&nbsp;training. The main difference is that in the Netherlands we also&nbsp;teach sciences, such as politics, social sciences, and economics.&nbsp;These are tailor-made for the profession and integrate writing&nbsp;and reporting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">CAR training starts in the students’ first year. During one term the students are trained in basic skills: e-mail, the web, search&nbsp;engines, html, spreadsheets, and databases. Sometimes assignments are very specific and isolated; more often assignments are</span></p><div><img src="when-nerds-and-words-collide - 0050_files/when-nerds-and-words-collide - 0050-1.jpg" style="width:66pt;height:84pt;"/>
<p><span class="font0">Peter J. Verwey is director of the new media department at the School of Journalism at&nbsp;Utrecht in the Netherlands. He teaches courses&nbsp;in computer assisted research and reporting to&nbsp;students in journalism and also conducts training&nbsp;sessions with working journalists. He is regular&nbsp;contributor to dailies and weeklies in the field of&nbsp;new media.</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
