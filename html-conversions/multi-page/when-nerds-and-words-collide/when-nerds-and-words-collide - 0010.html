<p><span class="font1">defined not by the computer, but by the application of social science research methods to reporting. Executive editor Lee&nbsp;Hills later wrote to me that the survey was an important factor in&nbsp;the decision of the Pulitzer jury to give the 1968 prize for general local reporting to the staff of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Free Press.</span><span class="font1"> The Kemer&nbsp;Commission called the survey one of the few “brilliant exceptions” to the generally dismal performance of the news media in&nbsp;covering riots.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">While based in Washington, I became a roving local reporter, helping members of Knight’s then-small group of newspapers&nbsp;with stories, mostly relating to the civil rights and anti-war&nbsp;movements, that needed bigger investigative power than conventional methods could muster.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The first description of this as computer reporting that I can remember was when a </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Newsweek</span><span class="font1"> profile in 1968 called me “a&nbsp;computer reporter.” The application of social science research&nbsp;methods was too complicated a frame. Computers were familiar,&nbsp;in concept if not in general use, and so that became the popular&nbsp;definition of what I was doing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">By this time, I was writing my own programs in Data-Text. Harvard had produced the software on a government grant and&nbsp;placed it in the public domain. I bought it for $10, the price of&nbsp;the 7-track tape. And I located several computer centers that offered 7090 or 7094 time at cut rates while the 360 generation of&nbsp;machines was capturing market share. My statistical skills&nbsp;increased. For a 1968 study of black attitudes in Miami, I used&nbsp;factor analysis to sort out the varieties of black militancy with&nbsp;guidance from CNN’s Bill Schneider, then a Harvard graduate&nbsp;student.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In the 1969-1970 academic year, I took a leave of absence from Knight to write </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Precision Journalism</span><span class="font1"> with money from&nbsp;and under the watchful eye of The Russell Sage Foundation. The&nbsp;book covered polls, field experiments, and analysis of public&nbsp;records. The title was suggested by Everett Dennis, who had&nbsp;coined the expression to contrast with “the new journalism”&nbsp;being practiced by those who applied fiction techniques to&nbsp;reporting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">That led to another error in framing. Because my most visible work had been with various forms of survey research, precision&nbsp;journalism became identified primarily with polls. While more&nbsp;accurate than the computer frame, it still did not capture the&nbsp;broad sweep of the concept as described in the first chapter of&nbsp;the first edition of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Precision Journalism.</span><span class="font1"> Polls, when done correctly, are part of scientific method, but the concept is meant to</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">cover all applicable forms of scientific method, including public records and experiments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">My first public records application came in 1972 when I took time out from election coverage to help Donald L. Barlett and&nbsp;James B. Steele with their criminal justice investigation. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The&nbsp;Philadelphia Inquirer</span><span class="font1"> was by then a Knight newspaper, and I&nbsp;worked out a coding scheme and rudimentary sample design,&nbsp;then wrote the analysis program in Data-Text. By that time, IBM&nbsp;7090 cost was down to $75 per hour - by the wall clock, not&nbsp;CPU time - and the three of us did the analytic work at a private&nbsp;computer center in suburban Maryland. In the tabloid reprint of&nbsp;their story (although not in the newspaper), Barlett and Steele&nbsp;included a sidebar crediting me with a “sophisticated computer&nbsp;analysis.” The criteria for distinguishing it from an unsophisticated computer analysis was not defined, but, once again, the&nbsp;computer was used to define the work. My field experiments&nbsp;came much later, after I switched to journalism education. At the&nbsp;University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill, I have sent student&nbsp;reporters into the field to measure the courtesy of motorists, the&nbsp;racial prejudice of pedestrians, underage alcohol sales, and the&nbsp;knowledge of pharmacists about the AIDS protection capabilities of different brands of condoms. In each case, we used&nbsp;computers without feeling the need to mention it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">To emphasize that what I was doing was social science as well as journalism, I did two things. I archived data, starting with the&nbsp;Detroit riot survey, with the Institute for Research in Social&nbsp;Science at Chapel Hill to make it available for secondary analysis by scholars and graduate students. And I found opportunities&nbsp;for my own scholarly publishing, starting with a reworking of&nbsp;my Miami civil rights stories for </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Public Opinion Quarterly&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">(33:2 1969).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">After three decades, the time has come to move away from the CAR frame and toward a social science frame. I don’t know&nbsp;what label to substitute for CAR. “Precision journalism” sounds&nbsp;dated. We need something that captures the notion in a fresh&nbsp;way. As reporters, we seek to draw generalizations that have&nbsp;more power than anecdotes or casual interviewing. “Scientific&nbsp;journalism,” which is how one French translation of “precision&nbsp;journalism” comes out, sounds too pretentious.</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">5</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
<p><span class="font1">Whatever the new term, let’s give up on CAR. Computers are used in so many different ways, even in the newsroom, that it no&nbsp;longer defines us, if it ever did. The time has come to declare&nbsp;CAR victorious and move on to a fresher, more ambitious concept. We need it, and so does the world.</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
