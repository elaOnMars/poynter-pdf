<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">By Nils Mulvad</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Introducing CAR raises a lot of opportunities for journalists to concentrate on education, computer adminstration, meetings,&nbsp;conferences, writing books, and so on. But getting stories in the&nbsp;paper will be the best proof of the technique. The bottom line is&nbsp;that stories count, and somebody has to write them. So you’d&nbsp;better learn to be good at that.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">That’s the main lesson.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Reporters in Denmark - the small country with 5.2 million inhabitants - are some years behind American journalists in&nbsp;their use of CAR.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">From the outset, there was a rather defeatist attitude toward CAR in Denmark. Common thinking was that if we did the&nbsp;same land of stories that were done in the United States, we&nbsp;would be put in jail. But in the last three years this has changed&nbsp;fundamentally.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Like the authorities of other Scandinavian countries, the Danish authorities have made much use of computers, but access to electronic information has been very restrictive. There generally&nbsp;is no legal basis for gaining access to electronic information.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">On the other hand, the Danish population since 1970 has had some possibility of access to paper documents, and slowly a&nbsp;practice of fighting for this access has developed. Over the&nbsp;years, one professor at the Danish School of Journalism (DJH),&nbsp;Mr. Knud Aage Froebert, especially has helped journalists gain&nbsp;access.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Although no right of access to electronic data exists, many authorities are prepared to pass on information anyway. Moreover, other laws can be used to formulate precise requests for an&nbsp;alteration of the existing rules.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">CAR requires persistence. My </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Jyllands-Posten</span><span class="font2"> colleague Flemming Svith and I learned this from a course and a trip&nbsp;around the United States in 1996. In retrospect, the strategy of&nbsp;introducing CAR in Denmark has consisted of a number of elements:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Using theoretical and legal reports that present the request&nbsp;to access electronic documents.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Persuading individual authorities to experiment with different kinds of electronic access.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Making the trade union, the publishers’ association, and&nbsp;DJH agree and compromise concerning the requests of the&nbsp;press; involving all parties in the work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Educating ourselves about CAR and developing our technique.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Getting international CAR contacts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Writing good articles based on computer assisted reporting,&nbsp;proving in practice that CAR results in better journalism. (This&nbsp;is perhaps the most important element.).</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Establishing an association and network of contacts for&nbsp;journalists who wish to start working with CAR.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Training journalists and establishing a CAR institute.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">All the elements have played an extremely important role in progress in Denmark. And we have been lucky. In the begin</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">ning, only a few people were active. Now a very important mix of people are active. Reporters in different fields of expertise&nbsp;have been able to cooperate. And from the outset, a very experienced FOI lawyer has joined the effort and used his reputation to&nbsp;make the field important. Moreover, there has been support&nbsp;from DJH management, the trade union, and the publishers’ association.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Naturally, there have been lots of problems and difficult decisions. Sometimes we have made the wrong choices and&nbsp;evaluations, but help and debate have made us able to move in&nbsp;the right direction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">One of the most important decisions was made in April 1998. Before that, the Association of Computer Assisted Reporting in&nbsp;Denmark had been founded, the first Danish CAR day had been&nbsp;launched, authorities’ experiments were in progress, etc. The&nbsp;first courses had been run and the first articles had been written.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Consequently, we decided to establish DICAR - the Danish Institute for Computer Assisted Reporting. Based on experiences from Sweden and the United States, we realized that a&nbsp;more formal and ambitious structure of CAR training and&nbsp;communication of experience was needed. The institute was&nbsp;based on three important principles:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would be non-profit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The association, i.e. the active journalists, would be in&nbsp;control.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quick action in the beginning in order to secure a stable and&nbsp;democratic system later on.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">And it has worked. We are putting the finishing touches to the statutes and a cooperation agreement with DJH. We have run the&nbsp;first courses, we have a home page on the Internet, we organize&nbsp;conferences, we are beginning to receive money, and we have so&nbsp;much work to do that the institute needs a part-time employee.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Then comes the difficult part - to write good articles based on CAR in an environment that does not include the same kind of&nbsp;open access to data as in the United States. That gave us a lot of&nbsp;problems. The first articles were not very good. But they were&nbsp;there. Our aim was to learn to master the technique by means of&nbsp;small articles and small sets of data.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The approach backfired. Many members of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Jyllands-Posten</span><span class="font2">'s editorial staff began to question the value of CAR. At one point&nbsp;we were forced to change our strategy. We had to delay and&nbsp;change the priority of the other tasks to make a serious effort to&nbsp;write good articles. Begining in the summer of 1997, participation in seminars, meetings with authorities, and the training of</span></p><div><img src="when-nerds-and-words-collide - 0048_files/when-nerds-and-words-collide - 0048-1.jpg" style="width:62pt;height:84pt;"/>
