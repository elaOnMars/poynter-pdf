<p><span class="font2">If his information allows it, Vidal uses Excel or Access to analyze and complete his reporting.</span></p><h4><a name="bookmark0"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">A few problems</span></h4>
<p><span class="font2">A real problem that we have found is that in many newsrooms, when owners or managers make an effort to acquire modem equipment, reporters often resist the necessary training&nbsp;either due to fear of technology or because they think their time&nbsp;is too “valuable” to squander in computing lessons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">We have seen too many newsrooms in which modem computers are reduced to glorified word processors, while the&nbsp;reporter doesn’t suspect the hidden resources that might be&nbsp;found in that unopened Microsoft Office folder. They find it&nbsp;easier to get help at their paper’s library or information center, if&nbsp;it has one, or to base their stories solely on readily available&nbsp;documents such as official press releases.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">At the same time, most media show little interest in investing in training for their reporters in CAR techniques. Their leitmotif&nbsp;is the recurring economic crisis, while in reality many of the&nbsp;owners and publishers in the region are still not convinced of the&nbsp;profitability of CAR and other modem journalistic resources.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">There are, however, some impressive cases, such as </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Folha cle Sao Paulo,</span><span class="font2"> which sponsors an extraordinary training program&nbsp;both for its staff and for young men and women fresh out of&nbsp;journalism school and other fields.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">There are also absurd situations, as when a daily from northern Mexico hired us to conduct an Internet workshop for its&nbsp;newsroom. After two days of demonstrating search methods,&nbsp;useful sites, and reporting techniques, we asked the class members to talk about how they used the web. “We don’t,” they&nbsp;answered. “Our management decided that it’s a waste of time&nbsp;and money and suspended all our accounts.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">We have encountered other pitfalls. For example, some colleagues have shown such enthusiasm about information&nbsp;obtained on the Internet or the hard data they run through&nbsp;spreadsheets or database managers that they seem to forego</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">traditional reporting, that is, the need to turn that information into an interesting story. We often read stories that are nothing&nbsp;more than a few dry paragraphs surrounded by tables and&nbsp;graphics, or failed stories that run out of steam three lines after&nbsp;the lead.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">This, we are sure, is something that will progressively disappear as the novelty of these techniques wears off among reporters and the public, and especially when data-dazzled&nbsp;editors pick up their pencils and start doing their jobs again.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Another related problem, which might be more troublesome because it can misinform readers, is that some colleagues who&nbsp;discover CAR don’t have a proper knowledge of the field they&nbsp;cover or even basic statistical training.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The increasing “friendliness” of Excel and Access, for example, can lead them to manipulate data incorrectly and reach unwarranted or even wrong conclusions that might then be printed as news.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">We trust that these and other problems will be the exception as Latin American journalism develops more savvy reporters and,&nbsp;of course, readers. Also helpful in this process will be the&nbsp;expanding network of CAR pioneers who, as they refine their&nbsp;methodologies and broaden their knowledge, can share them&nbsp;with colleagues who have just arrived on the scene. This has&nbsp;happened in countries such as the United States with the collaboration of IRE and NICAR.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Lastly, it is common in this part of the world, as elsewhere, for many newly graduated journalists to dream of becoming the latest&nbsp;stars of investigative journalism. And, as elsewhere, vacancies&nbsp;are scarce.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">But if more young journalists acquire and apply CAR skills to their daily reporting, the quality of Latin American journalism in&nbsp;general will improve, and perhaps we’ll finally overcome that&nbsp;old debate about whether investigative journalism is a specialty&nbsp;in itself or if, as Gabriel Garcia Marquez insists, it is a redundant&nbsp;expression.</span></p><div>
