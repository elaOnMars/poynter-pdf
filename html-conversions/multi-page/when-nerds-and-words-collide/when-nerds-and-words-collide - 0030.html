<body><h3><a name="bookmark0"></a><span class="font4">Evangelizing for CAR</span></h3>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">By Jennifer LaFleur</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In 1989,1 published a report analyzing the use of computers in newsrooms for completion of my master’s degree at the University of Missouri School of Journalism. At that time, most&nbsp;newsrooms used mainframe computers, and the Internet was a&nbsp;network of computers used only by government and academics.&nbsp;Some electronic information resources were available, such as&nbsp;government and association bulletin boards. For part of my&nbsp;1989 report, I conducted a survey of Washington correspondents&nbsp;about their use of electronic information systems. Most of them&nbsp;did not regularly use electronic information sources to do their&nbsp;jobs. Many didn’t even know what a modem was.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">I hunted down a few pioneers who had used computers to do stories. Elliot Jaspin used computer databases to analyze low-interest mortgages issued by the Rhode Island Housing and&nbsp;Mortgage Finance Corporation for the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Providence Journal-Bulletin.</span><span class="font3"> In 1983 </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Detroit Free Press</span><span class="font3"> reporter David Ashenfelter&nbsp;used computer information to generate a series of articles about&nbsp;inconsistencies in Michigan’s judicial system.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">I figured within the next decade, everyone would be using these tools. In 1989, Pulitzers were awarded to Rich Mauer of&nbsp;the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Anchorage Daily News</span><span class="font3"> for his analysis of the deaths of&nbsp;Alaskan natives and to Bill Dedman of the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Atlanta Journal-Constitution</span><span class="font3"> for his investigation of racial discrimination practiced by lending institutions in Atlanta. What’s probably the first&nbsp;CAR story was done in 1952 when Walter Cronkite did a story&nbsp;based on an analysis of election results on the first mainframe&nbsp;computer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Almost 10 years after that 1989 report, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">San Jose Mercury News </span><span class="font3">reporter Linda Goldston, who had only ever used her computer to&nbsp;type stories, published a groundbreaking computer assisted reporting story for which she was able to do much of the analysis.&nbsp;And she is not alone. Although computer assisted repotting has&nbsp;not become the new telephone of the journalistic world, more&nbsp;reporters find it an invaluable addition to their tool box.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">On days when I become frustrated that no one cares about computer assisted reporting, I have to force myself to go back&nbsp;and read that report and to think about people such as Goldston.&nbsp;Goldston didn’t use it because she wanted to be awarded the&nbsp;</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Mercury News</span><span class="font3"> golden pocket protector. She did it for the same&nbsp;reason pioneers such as Jaspin, Phil Meyer, and Rich Mauer&nbsp;began analyzing government databases - because it was the&nbsp;only way to do the stories they wanted to do.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">For me, computer assisted reporting provided a way to do journalism using computer techniques in a way that brought&nbsp;together my skills and interest in computers and journalism. I&nbsp;also wanted to prove my college adviser wrong. He told me in&nbsp;1983: “You will never be able to combine computers and journalism. You have to choose one or the other.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">I decided to ignore him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Early in my career, I met Jaspin and became enchanted with the notion of doing computer assisted reporting. I was able to get&nbsp;some free-lance jobs doing analysis for projects such as a project</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">looking at health care in Georgia for the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Atlanta Constitution </span><span class="font3">called “In Sickness and in Wealth.” I analyzed Heath Care Finance Administration data using mainframe SAS. I would wait&nbsp;several hours for my queries to run. My results would be a thick&nbsp;printout in the basement of the newspaper.</span></p><h4><a name="bookmark1"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Barriers to CAR</span></h4>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Lack of tools: </span><span class="font3">Ten years ago, the biggest barrier to using computer tools for reporting was getting the computers. Even&nbsp;when NICAR began training five years ago, computers were&nbsp;still a scarce commodity in most newsrooms. Until very recently&nbsp;this continued to be a problem. Luckily the end of the millennium has led many newsrooms to update their publishing systems&nbsp;to PC-based software.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The power of desktop data analysis makes computer assisted reporting much easier today. In many newsrooms reporters have&nbsp;access to spreadsheets, databases, and the Internet from their&nbsp;desktops.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Access: </span><span class="font3">Another barrier to early computer assisted reporting projects was the inability to get electronic information from government agencies. “We absolutely need an Electronic Freedom&nbsp;of Information Act,” Jaspin said in 1989. “There has to be some&nbsp;pretty strong language that says if information exists in computerized form, the requester has the right to get it that way.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Efforts also have been made to eliminate this barrier. The EFOIA makes electronic records subject to EFOIA, although reporters are still trying to see how much of an effect EFOIA really&nbsp;has had.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Skills: </span><span class="font3">The next barrier was developing the skills to do computer assisted reporting. Training programs such as the&nbsp;Missouri Institute for Computer Assisted Reporting (MICAR),&nbsp;the National Instituted for Advanced Reporting (NIAR), and the&nbsp;National Institute for Computer Assisted Reporting (NICAR)&nbsp;brought CAR skills into mainstream journalism. Thousands of&nbsp;journalists have been trained through boot camps, conferences,&nbsp;and seminars. Most reporters had some opportunity to learn&nbsp;CAR through these and other programs.</span></p><div><img src="when-nerds-and-words-collide - 0030_files/when-nerds-and-words-collide - 0030-1.jpg" style="width:67pt;height:85pt;"/>
<p><span class="font0">Jennifer LaFleur is database editor for the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">San Jose Mercury News,</span><span class="font0"> where she trains staff in CAR&nbsp;techniques, develops computer tools and databases for the newsroom, and works on computer&nbsp;assisted reporting projects. Before joining the&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Mercury News,</span><span class="font0"> she was training director for the&nbsp;National Institute for Computer Assisted&nbsp;Reporting (NICAR). She has been doing computer&nbsp;assisted reporting since 1988.</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>

<p><span class="font3">I am grateful I had the opportunity to be a part of the early NICAR training years and see the impact that organization has&nbsp;had on journalism nationally and internationally. I also wanted&nbsp;the opportunity to return to a newsroom and follow reporters&nbsp;from training through actual reporting projects. I returned to the&nbsp;</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">San Jose Mercury News</span><span class="font3"> in 1995.</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/>
