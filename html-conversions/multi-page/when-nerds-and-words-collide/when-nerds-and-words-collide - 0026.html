<body><h3><a name="bookmark0"></a><span class="font4">Reflections of a One-Eyed Man</span></h3>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">By Rich Gordon</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">There was a time - it really wasn’t too many years ago - when I began to have a vision of the future. Reporters could just sit&nbsp;down at their computers, pull up a trove of useful information,&nbsp;and use it, not just to produce big investigative projects, but to&nbsp;make every story better than it would have been otherwise. As it&nbsp;turns out, the future is now. The bottomless hole of information&nbsp;is the World Wide Web. And the web isn’t just a research tool;&nbsp;it’s an unparalleled way of delivering deep, rich data to our&nbsp;readers. So why isn’t our journalism better? And why haven’t&nbsp;we done a better job of getting actionable information into the&nbsp;hands of the public?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">I don’t mean to denigrate the fine, fine journalism produced every day in newspapers (and TV stations and even some websites). And I don’t doubt the impact that computer assisted&nbsp;reporting has had on newsrooms large and small. Though I’ve&nbsp;been out of the world of reporting for more than three years now,&nbsp;I still subscribe to the NICAR listserv. I am frequently struck by&nbsp;the sophistication of the dialogue, by the wide range of news organizations doing solid computer assisted reporting work, and by&nbsp;the huge distance that CAR has come since I took my first steps a&nbsp;dozen years ago. There was a time - again, not too many years&nbsp;back - when I felt I knew more about CAR than all but a handful&nbsp;of journalists in America. Now I feel far, far behind the curve.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">I also feel partly responsible that the two papers where I earned my CAR stripes - the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Palm Beach Post</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Miami&nbsp;Herald -</span><span class="font3"> have not become the well-oiled analytical machines&nbsp;that I once envisioned. In the end, I and my fellow advocates for&nbsp;computer assisted reporting still haven’t fundamentally changed&nbsp;the way most of our newsrooms approach the process of gathering and making sense out of information.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Yes, many papers now have a data “guru” who helps produce big projects and also frequently (more frequently than management realizes) helps other reporters do a better job on their&nbsp;stories. And yes, some newspapers have a library/research staff&nbsp;that provides the range of services needed by a newsroom staff:&nbsp;from training to acquiring and maintaining databases to conducting research on a reporter’s behalf. But you could still fire a&nbsp;spreadsheet through a crowded newsroom and not hit anyone&nbsp;who knew what to do with it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">My personal experience with computers goes back to my college days at the University of Pennsylvania. I was a history&nbsp;major who spent most of my days (and nights) at the offices of&nbsp;the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Daily Pennsylvanian,</span><span class="font3"> but I did manage to attend most of my&nbsp;classes. And I had a broader range of interests than most of my&nbsp;liberal arts colleagues, perhaps because I’d always had an&nbsp;aptitude for, and interest in, numbers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">So I took an introductory programming course at Penn, based on a now-obscure language called APL (which supposedly&nbsp;stood for “A Programming Language” - those computer programmers have such a sense of humor!).</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">I did well in the class, and enjoyed it immensely. So I decided to try a second-level programming course in the engineering</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">school and came closer to failing that course than any other I took at Penn.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Eight years or so later, I found myself at the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Richmond Times-Dispatch,</span><span class="font3"> embarking on a project looking at the impact of population growth on the state of Virginia. One of the first things&nbsp;I did was pull population statistics for every county and city in&nbsp;Virginia going back to the turn of the century. To put Virginia in&nbsp;perspective, I also found population figures for every U.S. state&nbsp;for the same time period. Of course, I wanted to figure out where&nbsp;the greatest growth had occurred. I knew there had to be an easier way than a calculator and a legal pad, so I asked one of the&nbsp;newsroom systems editors if he had any ideas. “Lotus 1-2-3,” he&nbsp;said. And I was off to the races. He already had it on his PC (he&nbsp;was one of the few in the newsroom who even had a PC at his&nbsp;desk), and he didn’t come in until 3 p.m., so I could bang away&nbsp;at his desk all morning and most of the afternoon. Of course, I&nbsp;had to type in all the numbers myself, but it was worth it when I&nbsp;saw how easy it was to analyze the population trends.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">When I arrived a couple of years later at the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Palm Beach Post, </span><span class="font3">I found other opportunities to apply my number-crunching&nbsp;interests, not to mention my typing skills. We looked at county&nbsp;commissioners’ cellular phone bills, bridge inspection data,&nbsp;nuclear plant performance records, campaign contributions. In&nbsp;each case, we typed the numbers into the computer by hand and&nbsp;went to work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The next pivotal moment was “The Color of Money,” the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Atlanta Journal-Constitution’s</span><span class="font3"> examination of bank home mortgage lending patterns. The </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Post,</span><span class="font3"> like the Atlanta paper, was (and&nbsp;is) owned by Cox Communications. Cox sent Dwight&nbsp;Morris, who did the number-crunching for the mortgage project,&nbsp;to the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Post</span><span class="font3"> to give a seminar on CAR and give us a jump-start.&nbsp;To be honest, his advice wasn’t much help - Dwight did all his&nbsp;work on a mainframe using SPSS - but his attitude and rigorous&nbsp;approach were inspiring. (See Morris’s essay on page 35.)</span></p><div><img src="when-nerds-and-words-collide - 0026_files/when-nerds-and-words-collide - 0026-1.jpg" style="width:62pt;height:85pt;"/></div><br clear="all"/><div>

<p><span class="font3">Somehow, I learned about the Missouri Institute for Computer Assisted Reporting, and was able to get a space in Elliot Jaspin’s&nbsp;first class. I came back singing the praises of 9-track tape drives&nbsp;and XDB database software. Fortunately for me, my colleagues&nbsp;at the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Post</span><span class="font3"> talked me out of both of those. We were able to get 9-tracks run by the paper’s Information Systems department, and&nbsp;one of the newsroom systems guys talked me into using Paradox&nbsp;(which he’d already purchased) rather than XDB. And somewhat&nbsp;miraculously, I was able to persuade my bosses to give me an intern to help on CAR projects.</span></p>
