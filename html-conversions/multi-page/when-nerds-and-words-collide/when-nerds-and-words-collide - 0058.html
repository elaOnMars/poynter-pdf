<p><span class="font1">About The Poynter Institute</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The Poynter Institute is a school for journalists, future journalists, and teachers of journalists. Our students come here in a search for excellence. Our teachers provide concentrated instruction and personal support in that quest. We focus our programs to serve specific audiences, but all share the same approach. The Institute prides itself on a style&nbsp;of teaching and learning that helps shape every course and seminar we offer into a&nbsp;&quot;Poynter Experience.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Our academic program is organized around four broad areas of print and broadcast journalism: reporting, writing, editing, and research; visual journalism; leadership and&nbsp;management; and media ethics, with attention given to the places where these disciplines intersect.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">We keep seminars small, which means participants get lots of individual attention. We emphasize a hands-on approach, so they participate in brainstorming sessions, case&nbsp;studies, discussions, role-playing, and other exercises to get them involved in their own&nbsp;learning.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Our resident faculty includes scholars, distinguished professionals, and master teachers who bring special expertise to every session. Each seminar includes visiting faculty, accomplished professionals who leave their jobs for a week to help teach, who spend&nbsp;time with participants inside and outside the classroom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">We want our students to leave Poynter better prepared to produce quality journalism, so that readers, viewers, or listeners can make better informed decisions. We want them&nbsp;to be equipped with new tools to handle the challenges of producing authoritative, responsible, and creative news reports, programs, and publications, and with new ways of&nbsp;thinking about the work they do.</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
