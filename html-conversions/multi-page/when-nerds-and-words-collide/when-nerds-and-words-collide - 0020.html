<p><span class="font1">was looking for corruption, not a feature story. But the computer findings surprised us: No raids were ever conducted on a weekend. My partner and I ran out to some crack neighborhoods. One&nbsp;dealer smiled as he told us, “Sure, we know about that. That’s&nbsp;why we are open only on weekends.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">To this day, I adhere to three basic philosophies:</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Begin small.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Think simple.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No detail is unimportant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">It’s not necessary to learn how to write programming language. Learn what is necessary to accomplish the job. The computer&nbsp;should serve you. With each story comes more skill. Before you&nbsp;know it, you’ll find yourself knee-high in magnetic tapes and relational database programs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Some industry observers say that journalists have arrived at a</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">technological crossroad. The advent of the Internet has dramatically altered how we accumulate information, and given rise to reader expectations. We already have multimedia newsrooms as&nbsp;print reporters double as television hosts, and assist in web page&nbsp;design. The birth of virtual reality will further transform the&nbsp;journalistic landscape.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Sadly, newsrooms have been slow to react. And the majority of reporters remain modern-day illiterates - unable to read a&nbsp;world of computerized information. Newsroom training remains one of the most inexcusable deficiencies. For most, the&nbsp;crossroads are still many miles away.</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">15</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
<p><span class="font1">The secret is not to follow the machine. Instead, follow your passion for the story; use the computer to track your ideas and&nbsp;test those hunches. When that happens, you will have a lifetime&nbsp;source like no other.</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/>
