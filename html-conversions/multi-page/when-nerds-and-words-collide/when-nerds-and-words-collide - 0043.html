<p><span class="font1">sketchy information from here and there and using each bit to leverage more details and to pin down more names and dates.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I used different gaps in different computer data left by the&nbsp;sealing of court cases to reconstruct facts about sealed cases and&nbsp;zero in on abuses in the act of sealing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I compared data tapes of teachers against data tapes of&nbsp;criminals. Data tapes of cops against data tapes of gun dealers.&nbsp;Data tapes of wrecked cars against data tapes of used cars&nbsp;re-sold but not-so-well rebuilt.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I looked at dispatch logs of not a few, but all emergency&nbsp;calls across many years to find where weaknesses lay.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wheeled a PC and tape drive into the governor’s office,&nbsp;demanding to make a copy of the state payroll when officials&nbsp;had foot-dragged, to prove that the governor was really adding&nbsp;employees, not cutting them, as he’d claimed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">My little stories made a difference. A union president was indicted. Judges were investigated. Laws were amended.&nbsp;Dangerous teachers were getting fired. Gun control was toughened. Car dealers were made more honest. A rural 911 system&nbsp;was created. The governor was forced to set the record straight&nbsp;on spending. I left my old job for a bigger one at The Associated&nbsp;Press.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">At the same time that computer assisted reporting was becoming mainstream, a parallel revolution in investigative&nbsp;journalism was happening - one that confuses many editors and&nbsp;publishers because it seems to be part of the same thing: online&nbsp;research. It was exploding in its usefulness and power. Meanwhile, its relative cost was plummeting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">This sea change began among quieter newsmen and news-women, news librarians.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The same digital automation that Elliot Jaspin had adapted to reviewing government records was being used to automate the&nbsp;newsroom morgue, cutting hours off a mindless chore every&nbsp;reporter and editor faced daily: looking up what was published&nbsp;last week or last year. As more publications did it, an economy&nbsp;grew out of everyone using everyone else’s electronic morgue.&nbsp;The tools for this kind of research, the personal computer and a&nbsp;modem to connect to other computers, opened up an infinity of&nbsp;sources for the journalist.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">It made sense for these tools to evolve in the news library. Librarians are educated to appreciate the issues of electronic research. They’re quicker to grasp its significance. Journalists&nbsp;are reluctant to admit a computer can out-report them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">I am continually amazed at how much I can learn quickly from online research and the exponential rate of innovation it is&nbsp;enjoying:</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Litigation. </span><span class="font1">In just the last year, it has become possible to do a search of all federal court cases by a litigant’s name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Business records. </span><span class="font1">Dun &amp; Bradstreet has taken its intelligence files on companies and loaded them into a relational database.&nbsp;The Securities and Exchange Commission is essentially all electronic now. Corporate records are easier than ever to search.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Finding people. </span><span class="font1">The choices for locating and identifying people are ballooning. I use Phone Disk, a CD-ROM product that basically re-creates every phone book in America, searchable&nbsp;every which way - and my whole organization uses it&nbsp;routinely. Professional directories are going electronic, one by</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">one. AutoTrack, CDB Infotek, and other detective databases are becoming frighteningly more comprehensive and cheap.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Government data. </span><span class="font1">The revised federal Freedom of Information Act of last year is forcing agencies to design new computers with public access in mind. Much of what used to be a struggle to&nbsp;get is readily available online.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">I used to hear editors and publishers say: “Reporters don’t need a personal computer.” A reporter’s computer was a word&nbsp;processor - a typewriter with a TV screen. Now, I don’t know of&nbsp;a newsroom in America that isn’t scrambling to cram all manner&nbsp;of new gizmos into its next capital budget. Computer assisted&nbsp;reporting and online research aren’t experimental in journalism&nbsp;anymore. They’re essential. They’ve been adopted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">And the biggest change in the decade since Elliot Jaspin began showing off his tape contraption is a monster: the Internet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Forget about magnetic tapes and modems - at least, in the long run. When I watch my 4-year-old nephew click his way&nbsp;around the World Wide Web, I am both astounded and terrified&nbsp;at the future of journalism and mass communications. Clearly, in&nbsp;the future, everything in the information world will be a website.&nbsp;Anyone who’s anybody will have a website, and use websites,&nbsp;or be nobody and nowhere.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The Internet is really just a set of rules - rules for any computer to talk through telephone lines to any other computer. But these rules work. They’ve caught on, and with an unstoppable&nbsp;momentum. They’ve reached critical mass.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">“Computer assisted reporting,” as the idea was first envisioned, barely begins to encompass what we, as journalists, will have to&nbsp;confront in the world of technology if we are to preserve the&nbsp;profession’s higher callings. Computers are becoming information appliances and are destined to be as ubiquitous as toasters.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Given where we are, and where we’ve come from, I think that reporters who have styled themselves as users of computer&nbsp;assisted reporting need to grapple with several issues:</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Get a name. </span><span class="font1">We need a better name and a definition for this&nbsp;intersection of reporter and computer. Words matter. “Computer&nbsp;assisted reporting” doesn’t make sense as a name for what many&nbsp;of us do. The novelty implied by it will never last. As a former&nbsp;colleague, Bill Dedman, once noted in an article in the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Columbia Journalism Review,</span><span class="font1"> it’s like talking about something called&nbsp;“telephone assisted reporting.” Of course, we use telephones&nbsp;and, of course, we use computers to report the news.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">It’s too much of a “duh” name. How do we differentiate “CAR” from online research? I’d argue there’s no difference.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Make new divisions of labor. </span><span class="font1">I don’t see any way that a&nbsp;journalist, a writer and assessor of facts, could possibly stay on&nbsp;top of the changing world of technology and continue to do his&nbsp;or her job. Technology is just too complicated. The tradition for&nbsp;the journalist is to function as a lone wolf, getting all the facts&nbsp;and writing the story. However, just as an on-camera TV reporter has a producer and crew behind him or her, we need a&nbsp;workable role for technology experts to back up the reporter.&nbsp;What do we call them?</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">We also need to resolve how one of the standard institutions of the news operation, the library, fits into a newer structure. It&nbsp;ought to be actively involved in the newsgathering process.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Admit that data can be journalism. </span><span class="font1">It won’t happen</span></p><div>
