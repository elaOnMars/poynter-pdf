<p><span class="font1">More importantly, they are given lots of hands-on practice time. They analyze databases with the purpose of seeing how to ask&nbsp;the question and without the pressure of having to come up with&nbsp;a story. Our CAR fellowships have had mixed success. While&nbsp;some of our graduates have moved on to other papers or into&nbsp;editor positions (not veiy helpful to our CAR statistics), we have&nbsp;others who are doing then<sup>-</sup> own day-to-day computer research&nbsp;with public records databases. News research’s approach to&nbsp;training and practice in computer assisted reporting is the same&nbsp;as our research policy. We will help reporters to the extent that&nbsp;they need help, depending on their skills and time pressures.&nbsp;They can do their own database work start to finish, they get&nbsp;help from a researcher when needed, or they can ask us to do it&nbsp;for them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">So what we’ve learned from our long and sordid history with CAR is that there is no one formula. No one approach works for&nbsp;everybody all the time. It doesn’t even work for us all the time.&nbsp;We’ve had to tailor our program to the personalities and skills&nbsp;and stories involved. And while those 27 stories produced by&nbsp;CAR graduates might sound like an insufficient return, it doesn’t&nbsp;take into account reporters who are using CAR in small ways on&nbsp;a daily basis, often because it has been introduced to them as one&nbsp;of many tools.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">From the early days of CAR, its proponents have insisted that it is “just another tool,” always comparing it to the telephone.&nbsp;Today’s journalist wouldn’t think of reporting without using the&nbsp;telephone and certainly doesn’t see fit to draw attention to its&nbsp;contribution to the story. What we’ve failed to do in making this&nbsp;analogy is to put it in perspective. Computer assisted reporting is&nbsp;hard and it’s time consuming. A big database analysis, like</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">in-depth interviews and extensive travel, may not be appropriate for some stories, but thinking about databases always has a&nbsp;potential payoff.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Of course, even when the story is worth it, you’ll find journalists trying to get something for nothing. You will always&nbsp;have to contend with editors who want results with no investment of their reporters’ time, and reporters who want results&nbsp;with no investment of effort. The best CAR reporters are the&nbsp;same ones who are the best investigative reporters or the best&nbsp;sports reporters or the best police reporters.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">CAR also needs to become an everyday research tool. News research departments spend their money and energy on anticipating newsroom needs and building the resources to meet those&nbsp;needs. Perfect examples are our book collections and the newspaper archives. The expertise at work here can also be applied to&nbsp;identifying useful databases and making them accessible and&nbsp;searchable through intranets or local area networks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">So the continuing issues for CAR in our newsroom are persistence and flexibility, both in training and in practice. The news research department has helped to provide the persistence to&nbsp;maintain our focus on CAR in light of the latest newsroom fads.&nbsp;We also provide a turf-neutral environment in which reporters&nbsp;get priority for their stories and a commitment to training. What&nbsp;we cannot provide, in the political reality of newsrooms, is the&nbsp;influence to push for the growth of computer assisted reporting.&nbsp;We are developing a bigger role in recognizing CAR opportunities and pointing them out to the newsroom, but we can’t “make&nbsp;them drink.” But neither can editors. A CAR program cannot&nbsp;exist without commitment from the top, but it cannot thrive&nbsp;without the drive of the reporters.</span></p><div>
