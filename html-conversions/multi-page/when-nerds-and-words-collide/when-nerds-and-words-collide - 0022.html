<p><span class="font2">lead, and how to find a detail in a police report. They learned these skills on routine stories, covering small city budgets,&nbsp;flower shows, and Saturday cops shifts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In fact, many journalists struggle with writing, interviewing, documents reporting, and news judgment their entire careers.&nbsp;These skills, which form the backbone of what many of us call&nbsp;journalism, take a lifetime of work. Experience counts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">But we seem to think we can add a skill - the effective use of electronic records - in a few days. And if the training doesn’t&nbsp;result in a major project produced more quickly than with traditional tools of the trade, it’s been a waste.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">This seems to me to be the opposite of the way it ought to be viewed, and I think computer assisted reporting specialists can&nbsp;help make that transition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Instead, we ought to warn editors and reporters, reminding them how many times they had to call back a source to get a&nbsp;detail they’d forgotten - an age, an address, or a make of a car-before it became second nature to ask the first time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">We can do more to build computer assisted reporting into routine work, as well. When I go on the road, I recommend that&nbsp;many reporters - particularly the most talented ones, who are&nbsp;most anxious about the payoff - use a spreadsheet or database to&nbsp;help them with work they’re already doing. They might type&nbsp;notes of a long court case into the spreadsheet, and let it generate&nbsp;the chronology they need to help tell the story. Or at least acquire a database that contains more words than numbers, or&nbsp;more anecdotes than data.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">That way, they’ll have the skills, and understand the risks, when it comes time to work on the project.</span></p><h4><a name="bookmark0"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">CAR as online research</span></h4>
<p><span class="font2">Clearly, the explosion of material on the Internet, and the growth of other online tools, has helped spread the understanding of the power of databases in reporting. These are nothing but&nbsp;large, sometimes unstructured, databases.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">There’s also a downside to the Internet explosion. Many reporters continue to believe that every fact or anecdote they&nbsp;need is on the Internet, and there’s no need to learn other skills.&nbsp;And others are framing the Internet as the “news” tool, with&nbsp;spreadsheets, databases, and even mapping programs as the “extras.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Many participants in IRE workshops are shocked to find out that their local payroll isn’t on the Internet. Or that they can’t&nbsp;fully background a person for free using the World Wide Web.&nbsp;Or that the search engines on government websites often miss&nbsp;the most useful material. Or that searching databases on the Internet usually produces a report to print, not a data set to mine&nbsp;even deeper.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The confusion between online tools and other tools is leading a generation of reporters to think there is nothing left to learn.&nbsp;They’re wrong, and their reporting will reflect that mistaken&nbsp;view.</span></p><h4><a name="bookmark1"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Public records obstacles</span></h4>
<p><span class="font2">Of course, threats to paper public records are emerging everywhere, and privatization of government tasks is making this more difficult. Some states remain easier than others. And as a</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">handful of tests around the nation shows, public officials often ignore the open records laws already on the books.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">But obtaining electronic records adds a level of complexity, and a wait, that many reporters and their editors find unacceptable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">This is where CAR experts can help the most.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">But overcoming the public records threat requires they become fully integrated into newsroom rites they have so far&nbsp;avoided - story planning sessions, budget meetings, and even&nbsp;editor conferences. It also requires that editors and other newsroom managers understand that they may not get records&nbsp;tomorrow. But they may have them next time the story emerges.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">These four factors have not just hindered the integration of computer assisted reporting in the newsroom. Some managers&nbsp;believe that, in fact, it’s as integrated as it ought to be.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">But I believe these managers have set up another false choice</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;one that computer assisted reporting experts have more power&nbsp;to change than any other. That is, the choice between becoming&nbsp;immersed in data and immersed in journalism.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">First, though, the promise. Years ago, many observers claimed there would come a day when computer assisted reporting experts no longer existed. Instead of the expert in the comer, they&nbsp;argued, everyone would share in the skills and use them as needed for stories.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Very soon, in fact, reporters ought to have no excuse for an inability to download a report from the Internet and sort it to&nbsp;help find news. And very soon, reporters ought to be able to&nbsp;search a database of public records for the telling tip or the&nbsp;perfect interview subject. They ought to seek out databases that&nbsp;will help them with routine daily stories along with new&nbsp;projects. In fact, I would argue that in many newsrooms, there is&nbsp;no excuse </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">now.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">But knowing what other databases exist, hacking through the bureaucratic doublespeak that still surrounds most local and&nbsp;state public records databases, and getting them into useful&nbsp;shape is a task that most reporters will rarely need. These skills&nbsp;are also the most difficult. There’s no reason that everyone need&nbsp;go through that pain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">I do think computer assisted reporting experts must define then<sup>-</sup> own roles more carefully. I think there are two hats these&nbsp;experts can wear, sometimes in the same job.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The first is that of a reporter - either alone or as part of a team</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;who shepherds a story through the reporting process, harnessing every resource and conducting original research. This is&nbsp;documents reporting at perhaps its highest level, the precision&nbsp;journalism that Phil Meyer describes. It adheres to the strictest&nbsp;of journalistic standards. And it follows precepts in reporting&nbsp;outlined by such traditional editors as Bob Greene of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Newsday&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">and John Ullman, author of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Reporter’s Handbook.</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">17</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
<p><span class="font2">The second is one of an editor. In fact, I believe this role is closer to a writing coach or a projects editor who scans the&nbsp;newsroom for the stories with the greatest potential. Make no&nbsp;mistake, though: This is a management job, and reporters who&nbsp;choose this role on a story oughtn’t be concerned with bylines.&nbsp;Their editors aren’t. They ought to be concerned with helping&nbsp;reporters get the most out of their own stories, not writing stories&nbsp;or doing the research for them.</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
