<p><span class="font2">My place in the CAR world would be that of an advocate for using online research in news reporting and for incorporating&nbsp;the whole gamut of CAR within the curriculum of college&nbsp;journalism education. I’ve written books and articles on the subjects and participated in numerous panels and workshops in the&nbsp;last decade. I came into this position through a slow, groping,&nbsp;tortuous path that developed into a major highway by 1993.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Here’s how.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">I had double-majored in chemistry and biology. By the time hand-held calculators became common household implements,&nbsp;I was a general assignment reporter for a small daily newspaper&nbsp;in central California.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">That newspaper converted to offset printing and cold type in 1968.1 got involved in maintaining those machines and a new&nbsp;composing room tool - a dedicated word processor. By 1980,&nbsp;we had several of these word processors, a number of phototypesetters, and a Compugraphic OCR device that was really hot</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;when it worked. As managing editor of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Daily Press</span><span class="font2"> in&nbsp;Paso Robles, Calif., and company vice president, I had responsibility for computerizing our newsroom and classified operations. The following year I computerized the circulation and display advertising operations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The mainframe computer that drove both our news front end and classified advertising sat in a small room with its own air&nbsp;conditioning and power. In the course of daily data file maintenance, we “talked” to the computer through a Texas Instruments&nbsp;KSR (Keyboard-Send and Receive) 820. One day in 1984, the&nbsp;KSR quit working. The people at Texas Instruments said it&nbsp;would cost $720 for their technicians to set foot on our property</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sometime in the next 72 hours. When I argued that we were a&nbsp;daily newspaper and could not afford 72 hours of down time, TI&nbsp;invited me to purchase a “preferred maintenance” contract for&nbsp;only $15,000 per year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">I left the service call open, but I was determined to do what I could to solve the problem myself. It took me about four hours.&nbsp;In the process, I had to download a shareware communications&nbsp;program (ProComm) from a bulletin board in San Jose. I was&nbsp;wide-eyed with my first views of FIDO Net and the wealth of&nbsp;information to which it could connect me. I had become “connected.” Through FIDO Net I found EPA reports and data sets,&nbsp;some FDA information, and even material from the National&nbsp;Institutes of Health. I learned that the Internet was some&nbsp;mysterious system that allowed different networks, such as&nbsp;FIDO Net and CompuServe, to exchange information.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In 1985,1 set up a newsroom bulletin board. Our county-seat correspondent began filing stories directly with us so that we&nbsp;were no longer at the mercy of a pony wire. Soon a political&nbsp;columnist working out of Colorado began using our BBS, and&nbsp;then we began helping a news service based in the state capital&nbsp;get ready for the online age.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The 75th anniversary of Boy Scouts of America in 1985 presented a unique opportunity for me to put this new technology to</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">work. I carried a Radio Shack TRS-80 Model 100 computer with me as I accompanied a group of Scouts on a two-week tour that&nbsp;culminated at the National Jamboree in Fort A.P. Hill, Va. I filed&nbsp;daily reports directly into the computers of AP’s Los Angeles&nbsp;bureau.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">During this same time (1984-85), I also got involved with spreadsheet and database software. Intuitively, I began to put&nbsp;some of this to work in the newsroom. I set up some automatic&nbsp;team and league statistics calculators for our sports desk. I&nbsp;poured key city and county budget numbers into spreadsheets.&nbsp;And I assumed that “all reporters” at larger news operations&nbsp;(most of the country) were doing the same.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Not until I attended one of Jim Brown’s NIAR conferences did I realize what a limited practice CAR was. By that time I had&nbsp;left the newsroom for the academy. I had gone back to school in&nbsp;1988 to earn a doctorate and to research the likely impact of&nbsp;digital information access and services on more traditional news&nbsp;media. Within the journalism educators’ association (AEJMC), I&nbsp;had become something of an advocate for CAR, especially for&nbsp;doing online research for news stories.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">It was often discouraging work. I organized a panel at Boston in 1991 that included Jim Brown of Indianapolis, Dorothy&nbsp;Bowles of Knoxville, folks from </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Boston Globe</span><span class="font2">, and others.&nbsp;At the appointed hour, our panelists outnumbered our audience.&nbsp;I had similarly discouraging experiences with educators well&nbsp;into 1992.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In the fall of 1992,1 wrote an article in an academic newsletter in which I cited and played off an article that Tom Johnson had&nbsp;written for </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Quill</span><span class="font2"> magazine. Using Johnson’s arguments, I asked&nbsp;journalism professors to respond to the charge that journalism&nbsp;programs failing to teach the entire range of CAR were committing fraud upon their clientele. I included my e-mail address and&nbsp;other contact information. A good number of folks responded -most of them agreeing that universities should be teaching CAR.&nbsp;Many of those, however, asked, “But who is going to teach the&nbsp;teachers?” The answers started coming in 1993.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Encouraged by this response, I organized for the 1993 AEJMC convention in Kansas City one “last” set of panels for&nbsp;journalism professors. Scheduled back-to-back during a four-hour&nbsp;block through the heart of the convention, these panels on doing&nbsp;online research attracted more than 200 attendees. One of the panels dealt with commercial databases (such as Lexis-Nexis and&nbsp;Dialog), and one of the panels discussed the Internet. Both sessions were “sold out,” and it was clear that we had finally caught</span></p><div><img src="when-nerds-and-words-collide - 0052_files/when-nerds-and-words-collide - 0052-1.jpg" style="width:67pt;height:85pt;"/>
<p><span class="font0">Randy Reddick is editor and director of FACSNET, an online research service. Reddick was a managing editor of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Daily Press,</span><span class="font0"> where he won state&nbsp;recognition for a project examining land use&nbsp;management and national recognition for spot&nbsp;news reporting in 1987. He has taught computer&nbsp;assisted reporting for NICAR, SPJ, and at several&nbsp;universities and has written numerous articles&nbsp;and books on new information technologies.</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
