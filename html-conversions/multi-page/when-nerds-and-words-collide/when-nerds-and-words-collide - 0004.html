<p><span class="font1">This book of readings is dedicated to all the journalists in newsrooms who have struggled and strived to use the computer’s power in the powerful&nbsp;reporting. The stories told here reflect - and honor - your stories. It is by&nbsp;your example that the promise of computer assisted reporting will be realized in newsrooms everywhere.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In addition, I’d like to thank Publications Manager Billie Keirstead and copy editor Vicki Krueger for their excellent editing work, under an intense&nbsp;deadline. They were able to take these different voices and create a beautiful&nbsp;chorus.</span></p>
