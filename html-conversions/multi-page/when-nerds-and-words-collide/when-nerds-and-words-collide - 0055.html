<p><span class="font2">PC- and Mac-based systems, others still are on legacy front-end systems, with only one or two PCs in a corner on which to do&nbsp;CAR work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Internet access in too many newsrooms is still through America Online and a slow modem. This is true even in some&nbsp;newsrooms with new PC- or Mac-based systems. The issue&nbsp;usually is one of cost for a T-1 line or ISDN access and a firewall&nbsp;server, but in some cases it’s also based on systems personnel&nbsp;not wanting to do the work required to install or support the&nbsp;systems. Unfortunately they often are able to convince&nbsp;computer-ignorant publishers that aliens will invade the newspaper if Internet access is allowed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">I do believe this will change - albeit slowly - not because reporters need web access but because those on the revenue side&nbsp;of the operation need access. As more newspapers produce more&nbsp;web products, advertising sales reps need to sell for that medium&nbsp;- and they can’t sell advertising for websites if they’ve never&nbsp;used, or don’t have access to, the web. If that improves Internet-access capabilities for our newsrooms, who cares how it&nbsp;happens?</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">I have spent a lot of time talking - and listening - to our newspapers’ systems managers. I think it’s important to be non-combative and to understand their concerns. But I am firm in my&nbsp;message that the Internet is an important tool that they have to&nbsp;find a way to provide access to. By the same token, I talk to our&nbsp;editors about teaching safe surfing and responsibility.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Cost also is a factor. Despite the fact that NICAR conference registration is low (and we even provided meals during our&nbsp;regional training sessions), some newspapers are unable (or&nbsp;unwilling) to pay transportation and hotel costs for trainees.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">One solution might be online training or interactive learning programs, such as the one provided by the American Press&nbsp;Institute.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In the spring of 1997, Neill Borowski of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Philadelphia Inquirer</span><span class="font2"> and I participated in the API pilot project to develop the&nbsp;institute’s interactive learning program for CAR. While interactive learning is not as good as a classroom environment, it is a&nbsp;solution for newsrooms strapped for training dollars (although I&nbsp;think the API tuition of nearly $600 still is too high).</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Over a six-week period, we taught a combined class of 24 students CAR concepts, how to use the Internet and the web,&nbsp;where to find data, how to develop stories, etc. Because we did&nbsp;not have the capability of teaching spreadsheet and database&nbsp;software online, we initially did not include that in the course.&nbsp;However, it became clear that the students wanted those skills,&nbsp;and so I taught both in a “chat” environment. (And I am thankful</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">to this day for Windows’ programs cut-and-paste capabilities that allowed me to do this!)</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Unlike a classroom situation in which the audience is captive, there are problems with an interactive learning environment.&nbsp;Students drop out because they are involved in a breaking news&nbsp;story at their newspapers. If they miss a week, they feel they&nbsp;can’t catch up, and so they don’t come back, despite the fact that&nbsp;we broke down the components so that one week was not dependent on the next. Some supervising editors also didn’t build in&nbsp;time during the normal workday for staffers to work on our assignments or to participate in scheduled “chats” (a vehicle we&nbsp;found to be particularly useful in the CAR course).</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">All that said, I do think that interactive learning is a useful alternative to classroom or workshop training when money is a&nbsp;factor. It was very rewarding to see some of our students (none&nbsp;of whom had been exposed to CAR before our course) produce&nbsp;stories using the CAR skills they had learned in our course.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">There’s also the issue of training at the university level. I sit on the advisory council for the University of Florida College of&nbsp;Journalism, and have been pushing the college to provide a&nbsp;CAR course for several years. Three years ago, the college started offering a class taught on an adjunct basis. (Debbie Wolfe of&nbsp;the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">St. Petersburg Times</span><span class="font2"> taught it one semester. See her essay on&nbsp;page 51.) Because of its location, finding adjuncts willing to&nbsp;come to Gainesville even one day a week is much more difficult&nbsp;than it is at universities in larger cities (such as Temple, where&nbsp;Borowski teaches on an adjunct basis).</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Ideally, of course, colleges of journalism should have fulltime faculty teaching a CAR class every semester. But college professors (Phil Meyer and John Ullman aside) don’t get the&nbsp;training for the same reasons that many of our reporters and&nbsp;editors don’t get it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In addition, professors sometimes are reluctant to add to their teaching load. Some of this is justified in the case of professors&nbsp;with heavy teaching loads; some of it is not. It’s also no secret&nbsp;that many college professors haven’t been in a newsroom for&nbsp;years and are still teaching their classes with the same syllabus&nbsp;they used 20 years ago. Nevertheless, I think we have to keep&nbsp;pushing our colleges and universities to teach CAR skills - and&nbsp;eventually to build it into then<sup>-</sup> curricula.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Despite the obstacles, I am not discouraged. I have seen great strides made in CAR training - and the results of that training -in the past five years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">And I use myself as an example. If a middle-aged woman who never touched a computer until </span><span class="font1">10</span><span class="font2"> years ago can leant this&nbsp;stuff, anyone can.</span></p><div>
