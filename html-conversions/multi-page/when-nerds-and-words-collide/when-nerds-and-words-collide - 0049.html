<p><span class="font1">colleagues were put on the back burner. Instead, we worked intensively on articles to prove the value of CAR. That has&nbsp;resulted in a number of good articles, and over time electronic&nbsp;data have been created - data that have been used in other news&nbsp;articles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Svith and I also have had the opportunity to write a CAR textbook based on the experience in Denmark.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Where do we go from here? Here are my immediate concerns and personal views.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most important is making the association and the institute&nbsp;run stably now that they have been established - very much like&nbsp;IRE/NICAR in the United States. The Danish institute is still&nbsp;weak, and it will take a special effort to make it stronger.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the institute’s (and Danish CAR journalists’) major&nbsp;tasks will be to get an overview of all the material Danish&nbsp;authorities place on the Internet these days. There is a flood of&nbsp;data that need to be structured and compared with other data and&nbsp;journalistic leads.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Continue the dialogue with the authorities concerning&nbsp;specific experiments with mailing lists and access to electronic&nbsp;documents, and the broader and more fundamental issue of&nbsp;formulating proposals for law reform.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consider CAR in connection with Internet publication and&nbsp;intranets - already very much an issue in the United States.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consider how the CAR method should function in connection with other computer assisted tools such as group work and&nbsp;mobile work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is still (and this is very important) necessary to work to&nbsp;generate more really good articles based on CAR. Perhaps in a&nbsp;few years when there will be a considerable number of active&nbsp;CAR journalists, it would be a good idea to institute a special&nbsp;prize for this type of journalism.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CAR should be made an integrated part of the training at all&nbsp;three schools of journalism in Denmark.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Looking further ahead, I see the following tasks for CAR:</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Basically, the aim is to secure democracy in the society of&nbsp;the future. Computers enable the authorities to exercise expert</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">power to an even greater extent without the citizens and the media being able to exercise control. We must do whatever we&nbsp;can to eliminate this imbalance. One of the key issues will be to&nbsp;secure the public’s right to be informed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should probably also consider how to make CAR an&nbsp;established part of our profession. That would specifically&nbsp;require more contact with other associations and more joint activities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should work to create a special set of CAR ethics. If the&nbsp;aim is better journalism and monitoring authorities, it will take a&nbsp;different kind of credibility with the public than journalism normally enjoys. We can set a high standard from the beginning. In&nbsp;any case, the performance of CAR demands that more attention&nbsp;be paid to ethics than is the case with traditional journalism.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Denmark there is very limited research within the field&nbsp;of journalism, and journalists tend not to read books and have a&nbsp;theoretical approach to their profession. If, in the longer term,&nbsp;DICAR can be instrumental in carrying out proper research and&nbsp;strengthening the theoretical aspect of the profession, I can only&nbsp;support it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;International cooperation is another issue. CAR has already&nbsp;brought about international contacts, especially to American and&nbsp;Swedish journalists, and some contact between Danish CAR&nbsp;journalists. This trend will surely continue. At </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Jyllands-Posten&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">we tried to find out whether an international project would be&nbsp;possible. Nothing came out of it, but it would be an excellent&nbsp;project once the routine is better integrated in Denmark.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last, but not least, there is the issue of international cooperation concerning law and rules. In this field, the whole Internet&nbsp;regulation and the European Union (EU) directive on personal&nbsp;data will make cooperation necessary. We have tried on a very&nbsp;small scale, but so far the effort has had no practical significance. I believe that this could quickly appear on the agenda,&nbsp;and then we must have a good and appropriate framework within which to tackle it. I have not yet quite figured out how this&nbsp;will be achieved.</span></p><div>
