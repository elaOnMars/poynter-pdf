<body><h3><a name="bookmark0"></a><span class="font3">The Contraption</span></h3>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">By Bob Port</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">I will never forget Elliot Jaspin with his clickity-clack tape drive contraption.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">It sat on a folding table in front of the classroom, a room filled with librarians, who aren’t easily impressed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The tape machine, no bigger than a suitcase, reminded me of the commercial reel-to-reel tape decks I’d seen as a boy in my&nbsp;uncle’s radio station, except that these tapes were the big ones.&nbsp;Government tapes, the size of a Frisbee. They were the tapes I’d&nbsp;seen as a boy on TV in episodes of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Mystery Science Theater</span><span class="font2"> during cutaway scenes of Cold War missile control centers. You&nbsp;know the picture: Dozens of closet-sized tape cabinets with&nbsp;tapes jerking back and forth. Rows of lights flashing. Air Force&nbsp;generals, bathed in fluorescent light, pouring over massive printouts. The sound of high-pitched Morse code in the background.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The computer attached to Jaspin’s baby tape drive was a state-of-the-art portable in its day, which meant it cost a bundle. It had what seemed then to be a huge screen, but would only be a bit&nbsp;bigger than one of those personal information organizers you see&nbsp;young stock brokers sporting nowadays. It was a monochrome&nbsp;gas-plasma screen, an eerily glowing red affair that never did&nbsp;catch on because it practically needed a car battery to operate&nbsp;without a wall outlet. Its boxy size and shape reminded me of the&nbsp;Singer portable my mother had kept in her bedroom closet. The&nbsp;kind with a lid and leather handle on top - so heavy you’d never&nbsp;carry it farther than the kitchen table if you could avoid it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Click, click, click, click, click.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Jaspin’s tape reels rotated slowly and as they did, a little relay clicked on and off inside. As inches of magnetic tape moved&nbsp;across the heads, lines of data appeared on the screen. You could&nbsp;imagine the words flowing through the cable into the computer.&nbsp;Jaspin pecked at the keyboard: G-E-O-R-G-E S-T-E-I-N-B-R-E-N-N-E-R. He poked the Enter key like a piano player would&nbsp;finish with a high note. Click, click, click, click, click. Seconds&nbsp;later, a couple of rows of names, dates, and dollar amounts blurted across the screen. Then data stopped appearing for a while.&nbsp;Then it quickly filled the screen, spewing out pages of listings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Wow.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">There it was. Magic. The fantasy of an investigative reporter realized. Every federal campaign contribution made during the&nbsp;last decade by the owner of the New York Yankees, who was a&nbsp;shipbuilder and colorful local figure in Tampa Bay, where I lived&nbsp;then. All this was culled in less than a minute from more than a&nbsp;million records. On paper, I imagined, those records would fill a&nbsp;room. With Jaspin’s contraption, I could squirrel away those&nbsp;same records - or others - in a desk drawer. When I wanted, I&nbsp;could shuffle this stack of electronic index cards and uncover&nbsp;secrets that would make news.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">This, I thought, was powerful stuff and I had to have it. I was in love at first sight - in love with a damned computer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">That was in 1988.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Jaspin, a gray-haired Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative reporter from the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Providence Journal-Bulletin,</span><span class="font2"> was showing off</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">for a Poynter Institute seminar. I was a 30-something reporter at the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">St. Petersburg Times,</span><span class="font2"> looking for a new idea. This eureka&nbsp;moment changed the way I think about journalism forever.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">For years I had been proudly doing things, as most investigative reporters had, the old-fashioned way. I’d pour over court dockets and real estate records at dusty hallway tables, making&nbsp;lists on yellow legal pads. I’d built filing cabinets filled with&nbsp;obscure documents retrieved from microfilm in government&nbsp;offices. I’d compared little bits of information in one place with&nbsp;little bits in another - by eye and by hand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">I was a scientist, of sorts, I told myself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">What Jaspin (and a colleague, Dan Woods) had worked out wasn’t easy. However, in an age of computer automation, it was&nbsp;so, so overdue. Why shouldn’t reporters use computers to&nbsp;process records? It’s faster and better. Jaspin and Woods overcame the big obstacles: First, most government records were&nbsp;stored on tapes. Second, most computers that could read these&nbsp;tapes cost too much for journalists to acquire. They simply&nbsp;adapted the inexpensive personal computer, then a new invention, to read big old data tapes. It was a natural.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Suddenly, the impractical became possible. With it, new orders of magnitude in reporting became possible, too. Why&nbsp;bother looking at a few records or even a hundred records of&nbsp;something? Let’s just look at </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">every</span><span class="font2"> record of something. Why&nbsp;not start a fishing expedition? The fishing is so easy. Armed with&nbsp;a computer, the journalist became David. The computer became&nbsp;a slingshot. Any subject was Goliath.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Computer assisted reporting, Jaspin’s name for his new system, became a craze for journalists. Many adopted it with a&nbsp;kind of religious zeal. Standard procedure was to locate a nerd&nbsp;hiding within the newsroom, usually someone who had used&nbsp;pocket protectors and slide rules in high school. He would be&nbsp;confined to an untrammeled comer of the newsroom where the&nbsp;electromagnetic radiation could be contained and, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">voila,</span><span class="font2"> impressive findings would emanate. If someone needed computer&nbsp;assisted reporting, he or she had only to seek out the CAR guru&nbsp;and obtain a blessing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Despite its mystery, there was no mistaking that stories built on computer assisted reporting had impact. CAR was answering&nbsp;big questions. It began to win many Pulitzer Prizes. Supported&nbsp;by an editor with a passion for investigative projects, I embraced&nbsp;this culture wholeheartedly:</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">Bob Port is special assignment editor for The Associated Press in New York. He heads a team&nbsp;of AP national writers who do investigative reporting, often using computer assisted reporting&nbsp;techniques. Before joining the AP in 1995, Port&nbsp;worked 12 years at the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">St. Petersburg Times,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">where he worked on special projects and&nbsp;introduced the newspaper to computer assisted&nbsp;reporting.</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
