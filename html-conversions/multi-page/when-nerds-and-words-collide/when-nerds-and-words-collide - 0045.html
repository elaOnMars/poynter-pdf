<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">By Pedro Enrique Armendares</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Periodistas de Investigation</span><span class="font5"> (PI) began its activities in 1996, as a project of Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) that&nbsp;was made possible by a grant from the Robert M. McCormick&nbsp;Tribune Foundation. The idea, presented by IRE members from&nbsp;Mexico and the United States, was to establish a training program in Mexico similar to the one IRE has developed in the&nbsp;United States and elsewhere for more than 20 years. The program would include workshops on computer assisted reporting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In September of that year, Lise Olsen and I opened the new office in the country’s capital. Lise came with many years of&nbsp;experience in investigative journalism for various media in the&nbsp;United States, and with a history of activism as an IRE member&nbsp;and a teacher. I began my work in radio and television, and then&nbsp;went on to cover special assignments for seven years at the&nbsp;Mexico City daily </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">La Jornada.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The timing couldn’t have been better. In the last decade, Mexico has undergone immense changes, and the country is still&nbsp;going through a yet-uncertain political transition. The economic&nbsp;reforms undertaken by the last three administrations have been&nbsp;accompanied by constant electoral dispute, the rise of left- and&nbsp;right-leaning opposition that threatens the dominance of the&nbsp;governing Revolutionary Institutional Party (PRI), political&nbsp;assassinations, and the appearance of peasant guerrilla movements in the southern part of the country. This process has been&nbsp;closely followed by an increasingly conscious and participatory&nbsp;society that, above all, is much more ready to demand accountability from politicians.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The media’s situation is also very different from that of a few years ago. Mexico has always had a large number of dailies - in&nbsp;the capital alone there are more than </span><span class="font4">20</span><span class="font5"> - but quality journalism&nbsp;has always faced an uphill battle against the twin devils of payoffs and censorship. The same government that could be more&nbsp;than generous to friendly media could also become a mortal&nbsp;enemy to a newspaper that ran “uncomfortable” stories.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Although the government continues to exercise inappropriate influence on the media, many of the latter are progressively&nbsp;more dependent on public preference and advertisers than on&nbsp;official subsidies. Government censorship, meanwhile, has been&nbsp;reduced to a level that surprises the most skeptical of Mexicans.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">All this is beneficial to investigative journalism, which although not new in Mexico, has not developed to the level&nbsp;required by an increasingly sophisticated and demanding public.&nbsp;This is especially true for CAR, which very few Mexican&nbsp;reporters use.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When we first offered our workshops on investigative journalism and CAR, the response was quite good and we encountered our first surprise: In spite of the marked centralism that besets Mexico, the interest in our project was much greater in cities other than the capital. Moreover, we also started to field queries&nbsp;and requests for workshops from media in other countries in the</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">For the ideas provided especially for this essay, I would like to thank Alma Delia Fuentes, information and training coordinator at </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Periodistas de Investigacion,</span><span class="font1"> and&nbsp;ideas provided by Lise Olsen during her tenure as director (1996-1998).</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">region, including Colombia, Argentina, Brazil, and Peru. The PI project soon went continental, and we have conducted workshops or taken part in conferences and seminars throughout&nbsp;Latin America.</span></p><h4><a name="bookmark1"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Both interest and skepticism</span></h4>
<p><span class="font5">Our initial CAR workshops in newsrooms in Mexico and other Latin American countries generally provoked a curious&nbsp;mixture of skepticism and interest. Although our colleagues&nbsp;recognized the importance of investigative journalism and many&nbsp;practiced it with impressive results, relatively few had used&nbsp;CAR tools such as the Internet, spreadsheets, and database&nbsp;managers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Moreover, when we showed examples of computer assisted stories done in the United States, our new friends reacted with a&nbsp;sort of computer envy. They thought the stories were excellent&nbsp;reporting, but they also brought up all sorts of reasons to explain&nbsp;why this type of journalism couldn’t be done in Latin America.&nbsp;Some thought electronic information was not available or that&nbsp;official statistics were not reliable in our countries, while others&nbsp;argued that few reporters have modem computers and access to&nbsp;the Internet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">What all agreed upon - and it is indeed a major problem - is that in the traditional political culture that persists in Latin&nbsp;American countries, bureaucrats and politicians tend to consider&nbsp;public information as a personal resource and assume the right&nbsp;to share it or not with the press and the public.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This problem is particularly serious in countries such as Mexico, where freedom of information legislation is ambiguous&nbsp;and toothless, and in countries with a recent authoritarian past in&nbsp;which journalistic investigation is still stifled by “national security” constraints.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In the past few years, however, we have confirmed that CAR is not only possible in Latin America but that its use contributes&nbsp;to weakening the official monopoly on information. For&nbsp;example, reporters can use the Internet to find information&nbsp;through alternative sources that bureaucrats and politicians try&nbsp;to hide. Then they can analyze this information using spreadsheets or database managers, and compare it with official news&nbsp;releases. Once the reporting is published, those politicians are&nbsp;forced to respond, and on occasion this results in the release of&nbsp;information that was previously controlled. This is not an automatic, or even a frequent, process, but it does happen.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Latin American reporters also are finding that some types of official information actually are available, including socio-demo-</span></p><div><img src="when-nerds-and-words-collide - 0045_files/when-nerds-and-words-collide - 0045-1.jpg" style="width:67pt;height:85pt;"/>
