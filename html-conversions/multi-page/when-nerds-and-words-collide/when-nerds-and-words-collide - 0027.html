<p><span class="font1">For my first big project, I zeroed in on property assessments for a number of reasons. First, I figured that I would find something screwed up in the assessment system. In an area growing&nbsp;as rapidly as the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Post’s</span><span class="font1"> territory was, there just had to be inequities. Second, even if all I did was explain the system to people, I figured there would be interest in the story - everyone is&nbsp;interested in their taxes. We were able to prove conclusively that&nbsp;property assessments were inequitable for people owning less&nbsp;expensive homes. It was not really a surprising finding - other&nbsp;newspapers had found the same thing in their communities - but&nbsp;the story got a lot of attention.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">I didn’t realize how good I had it at the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Post</span><span class="font1"> until I succumbed to a recruitment pitch from </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Miami Herald’s</span><span class="font1"> Broward County edition. I went to a big-league paper in an ultra-competitive&nbsp;market, but I lost my intern, my supportive management, and&nbsp;my high-powered PC. The best computer in the office was an&nbsp;IBM 286 that was at least five years old. I became a big fan of&nbsp;Reflex, a DOS database manager that did truly remarkable&nbsp;things with little disk space or memory. With nothing more than&nbsp;that 286, Reflex, and Quattro Pro, we were able to do some good&nbsp;small-scale projects. And I also struck up a terrific relationship&nbsp;with Steve Doig, the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Herald’s</span><span class="font1"> CAR guru. We looked at drunken&nbsp;driving convictions, population trends (the 1990 census came&nbsp;out while I was in Broward), campaign contributions, and more.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In the early days of the popularization of CAR, there was something of a schism between the spreadsheet disciples and the&nbsp;database mavens. The dividing line roughly paralleled the&nbsp;division between day-to-day CAR and project-related CAR. My&nbsp;experience, coming to databases only after mastering spreadsheets, convinced me that spreadsheets were the most useful&nbsp;tool for the typical reporter, and that the greatest benefits of&nbsp;CAR didn’t show up in mega-projects but in basic beat reporting. After one or two of the NICAR conferences, I think most of&nbsp;us who were teaching CAR concluded that there was a happy&nbsp;marriage between the two. Spreadsheets were a terrific entry&nbsp;point, but databases offered the greatest potential impact.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">At the same time, I think we have all been guilty of focusing on tools rather than on techniques. In order to convince others&nbsp;(and ourselves) that what we were doing had merit, we emphasized hardware and software rather than the analytical skills few&nbsp;journalists have mastered. When we named our field, we came&nbsp;up with a term (computer assisted reporting) that put the&nbsp;machine up front. I think we’d be better off using the much older&nbsp;term, popularized if not coined by Phil Meyer, of “precision&nbsp;journalism.” Because precision is what CAR is all about -moving away from “he said/she said” reporting and reaching the&nbsp;real, incontrovertible truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">From a distance, I see and read about newsrooms that seem to have made much progress toward the world of precision journalism, such as </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The News &amp; Observer</span><span class="font1"> in Raleigh, N.C., which&nbsp;has given its news researchers a lead role in information gathering and maintenance. Or </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Philadelphia Inquirer,</span><span class="font1"> where Neill&nbsp;Borowski and Tom Torok have helped dozens of reporters&nbsp;produce outstanding work, and then published their databases to&nbsp;web servers for reporters and the general public to use. But these&nbsp;are the exceptions, I’m afraid, and even these CAR leaders</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">would tell you there are still many, many reporters at their papers - and an even greater share of newsroom leaders - who just don’t understand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Unfortunately, I think the cachet of CAR may have largely disappeared by now. We’re not going to change journalism by&nbsp;teaching every reporter to use Excel or Access. We need to get&nbsp;reporters to think differently, to approach information more&nbsp;analytically, to believe that you can find a kind of truth with&nbsp;numbers that you will never find in anecdotes or interviews. It&nbsp;will require a broad-based campaign, targeted at all levels of the&nbsp;newsroom. But for many of our colleagues, it is already too late.&nbsp;They got into this business because they liked to write, not&nbsp;crunch numbers. They liked talking to people, not seeking&nbsp;answers from a database. We’re going to need to focus even&nbsp;more attention on the new people coming into our business -high school and college students considering journalism as a&nbsp;career, but also being tempted by the higher salaries and greater&nbsp;sex appeal of other kinds of work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">I got my opportunity in online publishing because everyone at the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Herald</span><span class="font1"> - including me - thought the web represented the&nbsp;intersection of journalism and technology. My CAR experience&nbsp;had given me a reputation, among journalists, as a technology&nbsp;expert. It was my former colleague, Steve Doig, who told me&nbsp;that amounted to the old adage of being “a one-eyed man in the&nbsp;kingdom of the blind.” The experience of managing our web&nbsp;operation truly opened my eyes to how little I knew about technology. I also discovered that successfully running an online&nbsp;publication has less to do with editorial content or technology&nbsp;than with managing people and understanding the world of&nbsp;advertising and marketing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">I regret to say that the websites I oversee (<a href="http://www.herald.com">www.herald.com</a> and <a href="http://www.elherald.com">www.elherald.com</a>) are largely static, text-based sites. They&nbsp;contain some wonderful content from our print newspapers, but&nbsp;we haven’t done much to deliver data. At one time, I&nbsp;argued that CAR disciples would make the best online&nbsp;publishers, because we had a “database state of mind.” What I&nbsp;found was that the state of mind wasn’t enough; we also needed&nbsp;a combination of hardware, software, resources, journalistic&nbsp;talent, and technology smarts that we have brought together&nbsp;only rarely up until now.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The web is going to keep changing our industry - whether that means newsgathering in general, or newspapers more&nbsp;specifically. Our print “mother ships” are almost certainly going&nbsp;to become less profitable over time, as classified advertising&nbsp;moves from print to online. Occasionally I am asked what the&nbsp;future holds for newspaper reporters. What I tell them is that&nbsp;newspapers are most certainly going to change and may even&nbsp;disappear one day. But good reporters are going to be in ever&nbsp;greater demand. And I don’t mean the kind of reporters who&nbsp;publicize leaked information from special prosecutors or appear&nbsp;on Sunday morning talk shows. I mean journalists who can find&nbsp;truth where others rely on anecdote. Those who aren’t&nbsp;intimidated by numbers, but instead seek out data to confirm or&nbsp;reject the conventional wisdom. Those who have a “database&nbsp;state of mind.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In short, precision journalists.</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
