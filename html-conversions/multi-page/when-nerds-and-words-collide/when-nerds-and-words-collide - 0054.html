<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">By Anne Saul</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">My perspective of computer assisted reporting might be different from most because I am not in a newsroom - and&nbsp;haven’t worked in one for eight years. Not only that, I never&nbsp;actually used CAR because it was an unknown tool when I was&nbsp;a reporter back in the “dark ages.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">I came into CAR because the putpose of my current job is to help our newsrooms deal with technology. Obviously, that&nbsp;includes a lot of front-end systems work, but only a few months&nbsp;into my then-new job, it became clear that our reporters needed&nbsp;help with technology, too.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The problem was that short of using a spreadsheet program to produce a newsroom budget, </span><span class="font2">1</span><span class="font3"> knew nothing about the tools&nbsp;required for computer assisted reporting - let alone how to use&nbsp;them. So, in the spring of 19911 attended my first CAR conference - the National Institute for Advanced Reporting. I’m not&nbsp;sure how much I learned at that conference - other than how little I really did know.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Two years later, I attended the first National Institute for Computer Assisted Reporting conference in Raleigh, N.C.&nbsp;That’s when everything began to make sense, and I knew what&nbsp;needed to be done at our newspapers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Shortly after that conference, we assembled a task force of reporters, editors, and others from our newspapers to address&nbsp;how we were going to get these new tools into the hands of our&nbsp;reporters and how we were going to teach them to use the tools.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">As a result of that meeting, we started a series of on-the-road training sessions aimed at teaching Gannett reporters and midlevel editors the basics of computer assisted reporting. Each&nbsp;session lasted three days and included hands-on training in&nbsp;spreadsheets and databases. Initially, Jennifer LaFleur, then&nbsp;NICAR training director, conducted the hands-on sessions, but&nbsp;after she left NICAR, we felt comfortable enough to assume that&nbsp;task. We also made sure that every newsroom had spreadsheet&nbsp;and database software; if it didn’t, we purchased it. In a three-year period we provided basic CAR training for more than 160&nbsp;reporters and editors from 56 of our 75 newspapers. (By design&nbsp;we focused on our larger newspapers because we felt their&nbsp;staffers were more likely to use the skills.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">We also created a private listserv so that Gannett reporters and editors could continue to help each other. The list has about 90&nbsp;members and is fairly active. It also has a website on which&nbsp;members can post stories, data, executable software programs,&nbsp;and so on, to share with others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">And we have seen very rewarding results from this training -as well as the training provided at the annual NICAR conferences, which are attended by 50 to 80 of our reporters and&nbsp;editors each year. Clearly our newsrooms - many of them quite&nbsp;small - are using their computer assisted reporting skills to&nbsp;provide more depth and sophistication to their stories - and to do&nbsp;some truly original project work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">I think this reflects what is happening around the country. Reporters and editors who were rank beginners at the Raleigh</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">NICAR conference are now teaching advanced techniques. The addition of more advanced workshop and hands-on sessions at&nbsp;NICAR conferences reflect that same shift in the level of&nbsp;expertise that has evolved in the past five years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Unfortunately, this is not true everywhere - and that brings me to one of the issues that needs to be addressed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">At our training sessions, we required that at least one participant from each newspaper be an editor, primarily because we wanted to make sure that someone in a position of authority&nbsp;could work with the reporters to ensure that they were given the&nbsp;time and assistance necessary to put their skills to work. In many&nbsp;cases that worked well; in some it didn’t.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Some mid-level editors have told me that they have a hard time convincing their fellow editors that CAR is a worthwhile&nbsp;skill. For that reason, they say it is difficult to get other editors to&nbsp;free up reporters’ time to work on CAR stories. As a result, the&nbsp;trained reporters get discouraged, give up, and, in some cases,&nbsp;leave the newspaper, taking what little they remember with&nbsp;them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Even some of those who have learned the skills - and who are doing CAR work - have not done a good job of passing those&nbsp;skills along to others in their newsrooms.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Many top editors are woefully ignorant of the value of computer assisted reporting - or even the value of web resources&nbsp;for everyday reporting. They’ll send someone to a three-day&nbsp;training session and assume that’s all the reporter needs. I find&nbsp;tins incomprehensible, since these same editors appear to understand that it takes continuing training to produce good writers.&nbsp;The top editors also are ignorant of the time it takes to do CAR&nbsp;work; they figure if you’re using a computer to do the calculations and searches it should be faster than doing it by hand. It is,&nbsp;of course, but these editors fail to realize how long it takes to&nbsp;clean up the data.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">By the same token, many reporters have the same attitude. They find out that CAR is hard work, and they don’t want to put&nbsp;forth the effort. Of course, most learn this after the initial&nbsp;training session, so if basic training weeds out the less dedicated,&nbsp;perhaps it serves its purpose.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Not surprisingly, our most successful CAR efforts are from newspapers in which a reporter or editor truly loves the work&nbsp;and is willing to find the time to do it - regardless of the&nbsp;obstacles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Speaking of which, there still are equipment and access obstacles. Despite the fact that many newspapers are installing</span></p><div><img src="when-nerds-and-words-collide - 0054_files/when-nerds-and-words-collide - 0054-1.jpg" style="width:67pt;height:85pt;"/>
<p><span class="font0">Anne Saul began her career as a reporter at the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Pensacola News Journal</span><span class="font0"> in 1966 and moved to&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Orlando Sentinel</span><span class="font0"> in 1968. She joined </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Today</span><span class="font0"> at&nbsp;Cocoa, Fla., in 1968 and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">USA Today</span><span class="font0"> in 1982. Her&nbsp;current job includes advising editors at Gannett&nbsp;newspapers in all areas of technology. She also&nbsp;coordinates CAR training for Gannett, was a&nbsp;co-designer of API’s interactive learning project,&nbsp;and she publishes a newsletter.</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
