<p><span class="font3">The “virtual newsroom” for journalists, the electronic mail list for Computer Assisted Reporting and Research (CARR-L),&nbsp;went online in October 1992. The seeds of an idea of a cyberplace like CARR-L had been planted four years before at a Gannett Technology Seminar in New York.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Participants were asked to develop an idea for some sort of journalistic, technological project. At the time, the idea of computer-based communication was still new. My introduction to&nbsp;computers, in the undergraduate world of the 1950s, consisted of&nbsp;learning how to set switches on the console and load card readers. Engineering students were still walking around with slide&nbsp;rules. After working for several years in Vietnam as a photo-joumalist for daily newspapers and UPI, I returned to school. I&nbsp;did the grad student/junior faculty thing and used computers for&nbsp;content-analytical studies and as a database for a book on Asian&nbsp;journalism.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">By 1985,1 discovered some journalists were already congregating on The WELL (Whole Earth ’Lectronic Link), in San Francisco, but this meant a long-distance call to connect with a&nbsp;UNIX-based system interface that even then was not very easy&nbsp;to use. A few journalists were also using sections on commercial&nbsp;services such as The Source and CompuServe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">My idea for the Gannett seminar was for some sort of electronic bulletin board system (BBS) where the journalists in the trenches could get help and support in this arcane new medium.&nbsp;At the time, few, if any, newspapers or stations had any outside&nbsp;network connection. A few universities and research organizations were connected through Bitnet, but any broad connection&nbsp;between self-contained networks was still in the dreaming stage.&nbsp;The BBS seemed to be the way to go.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">At NIAR in 1992,1 met many journalists using computers for many different purposes who individually felt they were working in a vacuum. The conference itself was mainly devoted to&nbsp;number-crunching. Aside from a mention of Delphi, The&nbsp;Source, Peacenet/IGC, and some BBSs in a handout, computer&nbsp;communication, in general, was still minimally used.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Bitnet was a network started by a consortium of universities to expand communication between faculty and researchers. One&nbsp;of the concepts the consortium developed was the idea of a “list&nbsp;server.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The list server would handle all the computer administration tasks of a given group of people. People would “subscribe” to a&nbsp;specific “list” of people with a common interest on a machine&nbsp;and the handling of the subscription would be taken care of by&nbsp;the computer. Given the scarcity of network resources, the&nbsp;program was optimized to run over a network of IBM mainframe computers, which most universities used at the time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Eric Thomas, a student in Paris, wrote the code for the first version of Revised Listserv that forms the basis of the current&nbsp;commercial Listserv program. Other mail list management&nbsp;programs such as Majordomo and ListProc would later copy the&nbsp;idea.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">For four years, I assumed somebody would see what a good idea it might be to connect journalists.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Finally, after some online discussion, CARR-L went online in October 1992. It was to be a “virtual newsroom” where journalists could hang out, ask questions, and get up to speed on the&nbsp;“new” technology. Casting about for an organization to host the&nbsp;new list, Jim Cocks, the senior academic consultant at the University of Louisville, offered to set up the list there. After some&nbsp;discussion, the list was named CARR-L.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Just CAR-L was felt to be too limiting. At the time, most journalists first thought of number-crunching when computer&nbsp;assisted reporting was mentioned; but the list was seen as a place&nbsp;for all sorts of journalistic concerns with computers, whether&nbsp;data crunching or communication. Librarians and researchers&nbsp;also were becoming more directly involved with the news operation, so the idea of “research” was included.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">CAJ-L was suggested, but Nora Paul at The Poynter Institute thought it might be pronounced too much like “cackle”; so&nbsp;CARR-L was chosen to reinforce the idea of “reporting and&nbsp;research.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Several foci were emphasized. First, CARR-L would be for working journalists; JOURNET (now JOURNET-L) was&nbsp;already online for journalism educators. This was not to denigrate educators and students, but to focus on the different&nbsp;concerns of the working journalist. During the working day,&nbsp;journalists generally have little time for peripheral chitchat and&nbsp;extended philosophical discussion. As an early message said,&nbsp;“We’ve got a paper to get out tomorrow.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">On the other hand, the list is “open” so anybody can subscribe, recognizing that some “working journalists” may be&nbsp;taking classes and some students may be turning out a lot of&nbsp;copy for publication. But CARR-L was never seen as a general&nbsp;discussion list for the state of journalism or a general discussion&nbsp;place for students working on term papers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Discussion on CARR-L tends to focus on solving particular questions. Recently the questions have ranged from:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How do I convert a PDF file to something I can use in a&nbsp;spreadsheet?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where can I find current data on child poverty?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are the best news sites?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How do I FTP sound files?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How do I check my ZIP drive for the “click of death”?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are some good CAR sites in Europe?</span></p><div><img src="when-nerds-and-words-collide - 0015_files/when-nerds-and-words-collide - 0015-1.jpg" style="width:67pt;height:85pt;"/>
