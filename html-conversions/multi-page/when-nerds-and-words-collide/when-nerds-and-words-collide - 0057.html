<p><span class="font2">About 20 people attended. For the Providence, R.I., conference in 1996, it took a flurry of e-mail messages among interested&nbsp;members to make it a part of the formal schedule. It certainly&nbsp;didn’t hurt that Stephen Miller of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The New York Times</span><span class="font2"> joined the&nbsp;cause.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">By 1997 in Nashville, hundreds of people attended the panel session co-led by Miller, Weeks, and myself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Newsroom technology training had come of age when it was recognized as the local and national answer for moving forward.&nbsp;The CAR revolution had ended, and the evolution was under&nbsp;way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">At one panel hosted by Miller and in the halls of the Indianapolis conference in 1998, many members were asking the question - where are we headed now?</span></p><h4><a name="bookmark0"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">The next 10 years</span></h4>
<p><span class="font2">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The majority of newsrooms will establish regular and&nbsp;continuing in-house technology training programs to augment&nbsp;national and regional conferences.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;National and regional conferences will shift their focus to&nbsp;covering trends and “How I Wrote the Story” issues rather than&nbsp;trying to organize topic-specific hands-on training for the&nbsp;masses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outsourcing news technology training to the human&nbsp;resources department or local training firms or local colleges&nbsp;and universities will dramatically decrease.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Technology training will be done increasingly by a separate&nbsp;FTE position within the news department. This is a new career&nbsp;path in the journalism industry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Technology training programs will be enhanced by regular&nbsp;visits from professional journalists turned consultants who&nbsp;specialize in topics such as: training the trainers, creating contin</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">uing training programs, mining all the gold from electronic data, special technical applications in spreadsheets, relational&nbsp;databases, and web-based (intranet) look-up applications. Consultants will serve to infuse local programs with customized&nbsp;detail.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Computer assisted paragraphs” on a daily basis for nearly&nbsp;every beat will become the norm.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Producing the news report will become more of a&nbsp;cooperative effort among journalists worldwide.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By 2009, it will be commonplace to see traditional print&nbsp;and broadcast media combining budgetary resources and newsroom talents to create the “new” journalism media, which will&nbsp;be electronic.</span></p><h4><a name="bookmark1"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">And after that?</span></h4>
<p><span class="font2">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;News organizations will have increasingly global staffs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Worldwide, colleges and universities will incorporate&nbsp;practical skills-based journalism into each course using state-of-the-art technology financed by industry and corporations.&nbsp;Hands-on technology training will be completed before entering&nbsp;the professional job market for the next generations of&nbsp;journalists.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Internships will be worldwide in focus rather than national.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Colleges and universities will hire professional journalists,&nbsp;experienced in the global arena, as consultants on a regular basis&nbsp;to infuse their local technology training programs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In-house newsroom programs will shift toward maintenance of data warehouses that will be shared among news&nbsp;organizations in geographically regional and globally topical&nbsp;cooperative agreements.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The era of worldwide electronic journalism will be in full&nbsp;swing by 2019.</span></p><div>
