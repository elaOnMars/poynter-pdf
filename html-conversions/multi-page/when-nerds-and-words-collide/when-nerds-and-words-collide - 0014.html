<p><span class="font2">Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS). Mike Berens, of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Chicago Tribune,</span><span class="font2"> is an example of the positive influence of the&nbsp;conferences. He progressed from learner to trainer, leading practitioner, main session speaker, and international trainer. (See&nbsp;Berens’s essay on page 14.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In the spring of 1990, Schneider and I offered Indiana University’s first course in computer assisted reporting. Two-thirds of the students were working TV and newspaper reporters. Each&nbsp;week we were astounded at the new applications those students&nbsp;found for newsgathering. One project on medical malpractice&nbsp;that grew out of the course won the Pulitzer Prize for Joe Halli-nan and Susan Heddon of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Indianapolis Star.</span><span class="font2"> That wasn’t&nbsp;bad for the first offering of a new course.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">After the 1990 conference, Schneider went back to the world of journalism. The NIAR staff continued to host five more conferences, which put an increasing dent in the small academic&nbsp;budget of the School of Journalism at Indianapolis. In the meantime, Brant Houston had built an excellent infrastructure and&nbsp;staff at NICAR. They offered boot camps of weeklong immersion compared with our two and half days of basic introduction.&nbsp;While something of a competitive nature emerged between&nbsp;NIAR and NICAR in the early days, we evolved into a cooperative and supportive venture. Indeed, Houston and his staff were&nbsp;very helpful to us in conducting our last several conferences.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The work and worry associated with preparation for a technology-rich conference is immense. The small NIAR staff was exhausted after the six conferences. Faced with the certain resignation of 100 percent of my staff if I proposed to host a seventh&nbsp;conference, I decided six was enough.</span></p><h4><a name="bookmark0"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Concerns for the future</span></h4>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Newspapers: </span><span class="font2">I have not, over the years, noticed any great concern on the part of newspaper management to further the&nbsp;intellectual development of their employees. This may sound&nbsp;harsh, but I know of too many examples that give evidence to&nbsp;the contrary. Many reporters attending our conference not only&nbsp;paid their own way but had to take vacation time as well. I find&nbsp;this situation outrageous. It seems reporters are treated much&nbsp;more as production line workers than educated professionals.&nbsp;But even that analogy fails because I know that coiporations&nbsp;spend a great deal of money training production line workers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Newspaper management needs a paradigm shift or a swift kick in the pants. News organizations need to start encouraging&nbsp;professional education. Reporter education and support is an&nbsp;investment to ensure continued importance of newsgathering in&nbsp;our democracy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Television: </span><span class="font2">Newton Minnow really did peg the industry correctly in the 1960s when he termed television a vast wasteland. Very few reporters of substance exist in television. Television, as&nbsp;an industry, does not provide paid student internships, nor does&nbsp;the industry supply college scholarships. They get what they pay&nbsp;for. While there are exceptions, not much of substance has been&nbsp;done with computers as a reporting tool. Stations are more likely&nbsp;to spend money on double Doppler radar than on support for reporting. While weather forecasting has improved, the quality of</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">reporting has declined since the early days of television.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">TV managers need to think seriously about whether they have the will to produce anything beyond entertainment. Television&nbsp;used to inform us about important issues. What happened and&nbsp;what can they do with the time Seinfeld has vacated?</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Higher education: </span><span class="font2">Curricula do not change rapidly. Political processes and factions on many faculties rival that of Congress&nbsp;in an impeachment trial. A convincing case for change is not&nbsp;made overnight. As journalism schools have evolved from&nbsp;having trade-school reputations that were not respected by other&nbsp;faculty in the university, there has been a growing slight of tool&nbsp;skills in favor of courses that fit more squarely into the university fabric. Faculty reward structures do not typically reinforce&nbsp;learning new skills and teaching them. Most faculty were practicing journalists when CAR was something you drive. Faculty&nbsp;don’t teach what they don’t know. And so it goes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">I hope that CAR training will become a required experience for all journalism students everywhere. It may take awhile to get&nbsp;there, although clearly progress has been made. I have noticed&nbsp;that basic training in spreadsheets and relational databases is&nbsp;very commonly available in other majors. Thus, journalism students are likely to be exposed to basic tool skills somewhere in&nbsp;their education, if not in the journalism major.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">But training in the journalism major can bring many elements together so they make sense. Software training is not sufficient.&nbsp;Formulating the problem is much more important. Teaching the&nbsp;mechanical basics of SPSS is trivial and doesn’t take much time.&nbsp;Knowing which statistic to use with a particular data set is the&nbsp;real problem. SPSS is useless without a background in statistics.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">I consulted with a journalist on a problem that had become worrisome to him. He was concerned with a 90-year-old truck&nbsp;driver who was considerably older than the other drivers in the&nbsp;sample. He wondered whether the age had been incorrectly entered in the database he had obtained. He was worried that this&nbsp;“outlier” would skew the mean age of the sample. I asked how&nbsp;big the sample was. He said 105,000 drivers. He had not yet reasoned the effect of one person on the mean age in a sample of&nbsp;105,000 persons is very, very insignificant. In other words, a little knowledge can be dangerous - or at least worrisome.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Statistics, taught with journalism examples and integrated with CAR techniques, is best done in journalism school. CAR is no&nbsp;less important a skill than interviewing, writing, layout, design,&nbsp;visual communication and so on. We don’t need to eliminate core&nbsp;courses. CAR can be effectively integrated in almost any course.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The important link is for the faculty to recognize its importance and to acquire the experience to teach it. These are basic tools to try to make sense of things. I will always be perplexed&nbsp;that journalism schools did not provide leadership in integrating&nbsp;analysis techniques into the curriculum. Business schools did.&nbsp;And they grew from “trade-school” reputations as well.</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">9</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
<p><span class="font2">IRE/NICAR continues the professional education effort. I expect no drop in the need for education in the next decade.&nbsp;Thinking about numbers and what they mean should become as&nbsp;much a part of journalists minds as concern for words and what&nbsp;they mean. It is an achievable goal.</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
