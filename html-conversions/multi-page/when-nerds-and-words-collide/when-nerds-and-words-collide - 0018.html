<p><span class="font1">staff with good computers should be ashamed. When every photographer carries around $50,000 to $60,000 in camera gear,&nbsp;it’s not too much to ask administrators to spend a few thousand&nbsp;dollars on each reporter’s computer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You have to do a lot of training to use a computer, and&nbsp;I’m too old to learn new tricks. </span><span class="font1">I compare the fear of learning&nbsp;how to use computers to the fear of learning a foreign language.&nbsp;Fear keeps you from doing it. If you go to a foreign country for a&nbsp;couple of weeks, pretty quickly you’ll pick up enough of the&nbsp;language to communicate. Likewise, I highly recommend that&nbsp;reporters go to NICAR’s total immersion computer boot camp.&nbsp;You won’t know everything about computers after going, but&nbsp;you will develop the confidence you need to begin working on&nbsp;stories. It’s important to know that you don’t need to have some&nbsp;advanced data analysis degree to research a story. If you learn a&nbsp;few basic skills, you can start working on stories immediately.&nbsp;As you use those skills to turn stories, you’ll find yourself&nbsp;picking up many new skills.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can hire a computer expert to do the analysis for me.&nbsp;There’s no reason for me to learn how to do this. </span><span class="font1">How often&nbsp;have you actually ended up with the same story you started out&nbsp;with? I start with a general idea for a story, but as I do my&nbsp;research, I often find that it changes and I end up with something&nbsp;quite different. If you give the work to someone else, he’ll do&nbsp;exactly what you asked him to do, but he won’t look at the information with a reporter’s eye. As a result, you might miss out on&nbsp;finding the story.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">For example, I once did a story on certified medics with crimes on their records. One day, as I was studying the EMT&nbsp;database, I stumbled across a medic who listed a prison as his&nbsp;address. When I researched it, I found that this guy was in prison&nbsp;because of sexual assaults on two boys. Upon arriving at prison,&nbsp;he filled out a change of address form and sent it to the division&nbsp;of EMS. They dutifully changed his address but didn’t revoke&nbsp;his license. They assumed he worked at the prison and never&nbsp;considered the fact that he might be an inmate. I most likely&nbsp;would have missed finding him if someone else had been doing&nbsp;my data analysis.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Internet is untrustworthy. It’s not a good place for&nbsp;a reporter to find information for a story. </span><span class="font1">Although I have&nbsp;mainly been discussing using the computer for data analysis, the&nbsp;Internet is another powerful tool used by computer assisted&nbsp;reporters. Unfortunately, at almost every conference I attend, I&nbsp;hear someone say he wouldn’t trust the Internet as a source for&nbsp;information. The Internet is like any other source a reporter uses.&nbsp;The reporter should make sure he knows where the information&nbsp;is coming from and should never part with his protective cynicism. That being said, I would sure hate to handicap myself by&nbsp;throwing away the Internet. In so doing, I would also be&nbsp;throwing away thousands of official government websites (such&nbsp;as the Ohio site that puts every state law at your fingertips) and&nbsp;millions of print stories done by hundreds of papers across the&nbsp;country. The Internet contains fact and fiction, just as books do;&nbsp;it’s our job as reporters to determine which is which.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">It is with trepidation that I cite reasons why journalists should learn about computer assisted reporting. Citing reasons implies&nbsp;there is a choice. I don’t think there </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">is</span><span class="font1"> a choice. Television</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">journalists who refuse to start picking up the skills of computer assisted reporting will one day find themselves left far behind,&nbsp;and not just by other reporters.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Our industry is changing before our eyes. For a moment. I’m going to step away from computer research and talk about the&nbsp;distribution of our product. Most reporters (and managers) in the&nbsp;television industry have given little thought to how our product&nbsp;is distributed. They take for granted that broadcast television&nbsp;will be around forever.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Before your eyes glaze over with this topic, ask yourself what you would be doing if local television suddenly ceased to exist.&nbsp;While that may not happen completely, television will almost&nbsp;certainly change dramatically in the next few years, and it may&nbsp;not change the way we want it to. After the November 1998&nbsp;ratings period, the number one question at stations across the&nbsp;country wasn’t, “Who’s number one?” It was, “Where are our&nbsp;viewers going?” They’re leaving broadcast television, which&nbsp;means advertising budgets likely will begin to dwindle. If that&nbsp;happens, you can bet news budgets will be cut.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">We know why our viewers are leaving us. They’re going to cable and to the Internet. But we haven’t decided how we’re&nbsp;going to adjust our skills and product so we can continue to exist&nbsp;in this new media environment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">That brings us back to computer assisted reporting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Using this skill allows us to generate unique and hard-hitting content for daily stories as well as for in-depth projects. If&nbsp;there’s a bad rap on television, it’s that we’re shallow. We’re&nbsp;great at live shots and fast-paced stories, but we’re often murky&nbsp;on the details. When news consumers of the future are deciding&nbsp;where to go to for credible information, carrying the label&nbsp;“shallow” will kill us. What we need more than anything else is&nbsp;great content that consumers will trust. Computer assisted&nbsp;reporting will help us develop that content and credibility.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">For daily stories, we can survey the resources of the Internet and the millions of print stories that exist there to help find&nbsp;context for our stories. We can also use in-house databases to&nbsp;make us better and quicker at doing our jobs. For instance, a&nbsp;state payroll database might lead us to an employee involved in&nbsp;a scandal on the day the scandal breaks - when people in his office won’t even talk to us. For big stories, data analysis projects&nbsp;give us depth normally unseen on television. Finally, the more&nbsp;stories we do based on research of databases, the more interactive information we can offer to our viewers on the Internet,&nbsp;which will help us build credibility in a medium other than television.</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">13</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
<p><span class="font1">So how do we get there? I believe news organizations need to make commitments to begin training eveiy content-producing&nbsp;employee in basic computer assisted reporting. That only&nbsp;sounds scary because we think of computer assisted reporters as&nbsp;specialists with a great deal of computer knowledge. We need to&nbsp;get past that attitude and start thinking about CAR as a tool all&nbsp;reporters should have on their tool belt. It’s a skill, like interviewing or researching or writing, that can help any good&nbsp;reporter become a better reporter. We shouldn’t all become&nbsp;specialists, but we should all understand the basics of using a&nbsp;computer to help research our stories.</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/>
