<p><span class="font16">By Nora Paul</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">1989 was a watershed year for journalism. During the 1980s. the power of personal computers increased and the cost&nbsp;dropped. More and more government records were being shifted&nbsp;from paper to electronic fonnat. The message of Phil Meyer’s&nbsp;classic text. </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Precision Journalism,</span><span class="font16"> reached an audience of talented journalists who wanted to incorporate its promise of enterprise journalism and analysis into their reporting. These threads&nbsp;came together in 1989 with the establishment of two different&nbsp;organizations, organizations that would change many journalists’ perceptions from the computer as a word processor to the&nbsp;computer as a partner on their reporting team.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">In Indianapolis, Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Andy Schneider joined the faculty of Indiana University School of Journalism and soon found a kindred spirit in Jim Brown. Together&nbsp;they conceived a way to begin spreading the word more broadly&nbsp;about the techniques of computer use in reporting. They named it&nbsp;the National Institute for Advanced Reporting (NIAR) and began&nbsp;making plans for the first conference to teach and discuss these&nbsp;techniques. (See Jim Brown's essay on page 8 for more details&nbsp;about the foundation of NIAR and the first conference.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">At the University of Missouri, Elliot Jaspin created the Missouri Institute for Computer Assisted Reporting (MICAR), which held computer “boot camps” for journalists who wanted&nbsp;to be indoctrinated in the techniques of computer use in reporting. (See Brant Houston’s essay on page 6 for more details about&nbsp;the foundation of MICAR and its evolution to the National Institute for Computer Assisted Reporting, orNICAR.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">One of the key developments that brought the potential of data analysis to reporters also was rolled out that year by Jaspin.&nbsp;With project partner Dan Woods, Jaspin created 9-Track Express, a way to use personal computers to manage the huge data&nbsp;files government agencies put onto 9-track tapes that previously&nbsp;had required mainframe computers to process.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Through these training initiatives, grassroots industry buzz about CAR, and some high-profile, prize-winning stories that&nbsp;relied on computer analysis techniques, the dawn of the computer age in newsrooms seemed sunny and assured.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">But 10 years later, just what is the state of computer assisted reporting in newsrooms in the United States and around the&nbsp;world? According to a gathering at Poynter in January 1999.&nbsp;there is some good news and some bad news. Gains in the equipment (case of use, lowered cost, better software) have been&nbsp;weighed down by over-extended journalists who see using this&nbsp;suite of skills as a burden, rather than as a reporting opportunity.&nbsp;While it is true that CAR over the past 10 years has come to be&nbsp;seen as a way to do stories that couldn’t be done otherwise and&nbsp;helps fulfill the journalist's watchdog role, it is also true that&nbsp;these techniques can be hard work (from data acquisition to&nbsp;analysis), that they arc currently underutilized, and that many reporters still want to do things the “easy” way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">What can be done to help promote the use of computer analysis of data to reveal new stories, to verity (or nullify) popular</span></p><img src="when-nerds-and-words-collide_files/when-nerds-and-words-collide-4.jpg" style="width:121pt;height:156pt;"/>
<p><span class="font6">Nora Paul is a faculty member at The Poynter Institute for Media Studies and conducts seminars in the areas of news research and news&nbsp;library management. computer assisted&nbsp;reporting. and leadership in new media newsrooms. She came to Poynter in 1991 after 1? years&nbsp;at </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">The </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Miami Herald.</span><span class="font6"> She is a frequent speaker at&nbsp;journalism conferences and cofxlucts newsroom&nbsp;workshops and Internet training courses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">conceptions, and to provide the information checks and balances in an increasingly data-based world? The Poynter Institute,&nbsp;NTAR, and N1CAR wanted to know.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Together we decided to convene a group of 22 pioneers and practitioners of CAR techniques. They came to Poynter and, for&nbsp;two and a half days, discussed how CAR has changed the face of&nbsp;journalism and how it hasn’t. After establishing the continuum&nbsp;of CAR techniques - from use of e-mail, to searching online&nbsp;archives, to using the Internet, to use of spreadsheets, to developing databases, to social science research techniques - we all&nbsp;agreed that the battle line for CAR use was drawn at the level of&nbsp;spreadsheet use and above. E-mail, online archive use, and the&nbsp;Internet were, for a majority of journalists, a standard set of tools&nbsp;they used. It was these other tools of computer use in reporting&nbsp;that we wanted to assess.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">We asked the group to help us identify the issues that continue to challenge journalists interested in using these techniques in&nbsp;their reporting and newsgathering. We had them advise us on the&nbsp;kinds of research projects we should undertake that could help&nbsp;the industry understand the impact of CAR work on journalism.&nbsp;Wc challenged them to identify the tools, resources, or guidelines journalists still need that can help them use these techniques with more confidence and ease. Here are some of the&nbsp;highlights:</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Issues</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">The issue areas identified by the group fell into five broad categories with specific concerns under each:</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Skills/professionalization</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deciding whether CAR/numeracy should be a job requirement for journalists and at what level.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Establishing our identity as a profession.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Putting CAR skills/numeracy on entry-level skills tests and&nbsp;regular performance reviews.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Defining what wc do in terms of objectives instead of tools,&nbsp;clarifying the vision of CAR, and figuring out how to brand and&nbsp;sell it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Promoting social science principles into the daily practice&nbsp;of journalism.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Creating a well-described set of skills for doing CAR and&nbsp;developing industry standards regarding technology skills and&nbsp;knowledge.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Developing a full tool box of reporting skills that integrate&nbsp;CAR with other skills (social science, traditional reporting, civic</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">journalism, etc.).</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Retrofitting beats to incorporate CAR skills and developing&nbsp;a model for all to use.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Integrating CAR into daily journalism, helping journalists&nbsp;realize it’s not just for big project reporting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Removing the false choice in the newsroom between storytelling and CAR.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Organizational infrastructure/support</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Getting buy-in for CAR from top editors, moving them&nbsp;from acceptance to active participation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Getting help from assignment and line editors (who often&nbsp;don’t understand CAR techniques), so they can provide more effective editing backup to CAR stories.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Developing strategies and benchmarks that get management to raise the bar for reporters and editors.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Restructuring newsrooms to promote CAR use (personnel,&nbsp;technology, organization).</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Overcoming cultural lag in the newsroom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Product/content: “Doing well by doing good”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inculcating belief among newspaper owners/managers that&nbsp;good journalism is profitable journalism.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Determining whether CAR informs the public better. Does&nbsp;it enhance the public’s knowledge?</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Determining the mission of the organization. If it is to&nbsp;produce the best possible content, CAR and good journalism&nbsp;happen.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Helping journalists in TV newsrooms learn and use CAR&nbsp;techniques in the fast-paced environment and provide a system&nbsp;for producing quality CAR stories.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Getting CAR into news organizations’ vision and goals,&nbsp;getting management support/buy-in.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Developing opportunities for cross-company collaboration&nbsp;on CAR projects.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Access</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Technology integration: creating a structure/organization to&nbsp;collect and analyze data and share it with reporters.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Technological barriers: overcoming problems with incompatible systems, insufficient equipment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Making the use of CAR tools easier in order to facilitate&nbsp;access and use by reporters.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Determining the level of support needed: equipment, people, time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Improving collaboration with systems editors, helping&nbsp;them understand the needs of the CAR reporter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Understanding globalization of information through better&nbsp;access to international resources, resulting in more globalized&nbsp;reporting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taking advantage of the multiple media opportunities for&nbsp;distribution of CAR stories (print, broadcast, online).</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Answering concerns about protection of privacy with the&nbsp;greater access to information, clarifying journalistic demands and&nbsp;ethics, reconciling public access to public records vs. privacy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ensuring journalists’ and news consumers’ understanding&nbsp;of the relevance of data revealed in CAR analysis.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Achieving better interaction with online news, getting online folks more interested in working with CAR projects.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Monitoring electronic FOIA and public records access.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anticipating growing privatization of government services&nbsp;(i.e.: prison system) resulting in growing number of private,&nbsp;rather than public, records.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anticipating and helping design European law for public&nbsp;records access.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Teaching/training</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Re-thinking journalism education - what should we expect&nbsp;from new journalists?</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Integrating CAR into J-school curricula, particularly for&nbsp;undergraduates.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Improving journalism education to incorporate “advanced&nbsp;reporting” techniques and getting faculty interested in CAR.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teaching math skills to journalists and integrating number&nbsp;crunching with the teaching of good storytelling.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Developing approaches for training journalists in CAR&nbsp;techniques, recognizing computer phobia/time-related excuses&nbsp;and real constraints.</span></p>

<p><span class="font12">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teaching conceptualization, application of “scientific” logic, and reasoning to data analysis.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Improving the use of public documents in reporting - electronic or paper.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Figuring out how to conduct continuing training - journalism is a continuing-education profession.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Training for editors to produce CAR-competent editors to&nbsp;backstop reporters.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Training for management on how to evaluate CAR skills.</span></p><h4><a name="bookmark24"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Project ideas</span></h4>
<p><span class="font12">In the discussions that followed from this inventory of issues, six priority projects were proposed. These were:</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Help the assigning/line editors help us: </span><span class="font12">The most essential person to journalists working on CAR projects is their editor, but&nbsp;too often the editor doesn’t know much about these techniques.&nbsp;An editor can help reporters who are using traditional reporting&nbsp;techniques; an editor knows how to question a journalist who had&nbsp;interviewed a person, but not one who has interviewed data. Editors need some help.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">IDEA: Write a handbook, “What Every Editor Needs to Know About CAR,” focusing not on the technical aspects but&nbsp;the practical questions they should know to ask.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Catalog </span><span class="font12">the </span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">resources: </span><span class="font12">Data access is the make or break point for CAR work. Negotiating the acquisition of records, understanding the pitfalls of using the records, developing ideas for&nbsp;reporting from the records, and making access to the information&nbsp;in the records available to other journalists are the challenges. In&nbsp;newsrooms all around the country, journalists have negotiated for&nbsp;records and figured out how to make it easier for others to use them.&nbsp;We’d like to gather information on those records, how much they&nbsp;cost, what was involved in getting them, and how they are being used.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">IDEA: Create a database of databases to which individual newsrooms can contribute. This could be an internal record-</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">keeping resource as well as a network of information about data being used in newsrooms.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Help the J-schools: </span><span class="font12">Integrating CAR skills into traditional journalism training has been a challenge. Should journalism&nbsp;educators have elements of it in all classes, or give one class and&nbsp;hope the students apply those skills in other reporting/writing&nbsp;courses? Journalism educators have tried various approaches.&nbsp;What is working? What suggestions might there be for educators?</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">IDEA: Develop some sample syllabi for journalism courses that incorporate CAR skills within the journalism curriculum.&nbsp;Also, canvass the journalism schools and find out their current&nbsp;CAR curriculum approaches as a way to provide some ideas and&nbsp;contacts to others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Elevate numeracy: </span><span class="font12">Numbers and understanding what they mean are the crux of CAR work. Too many journalists are math-phobic and uncertain in their interpretation of the significance of&nbsp;numerical data or how to do certain types of calculations. We&nbsp;need to help improve their competence and confidence in this&nbsp;critical area of journalistic work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">IDEA: Create a math/spreadsheet competency self-test (along with a pre-test tutorial and clear explanation sheet for how to&nbsp;work the problems for self-evaluation).</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Skills assessment: </span><span class="font12">Just what comprises the suite of CAR skills? What techniques are involved? What processes are required for different techniques? How can journalists’ skill levels&nbsp;be evaluated, and how can they set their own learning goals? We&nbsp;need a skills assessment inventory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">IDEA: Develop a list of CAR competencies that naturally build on each other and develop tests that can help determine&nbsp;skill levels reached after appropriate training.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Who’s doing what we should be doing and how did they do it? </span><span class="font12">Various models and approaches have been taken for the&nbsp;use of CAR in newsrooms, from the “geek in the comer” to the&nbsp;“arm everyone who can shoot.” What approaches have been effective in newsrooms wanting to move CAR use forward, and&nbsp;why have they been effective?</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">IDEA: Analyze the CAR operations in a variety of newsrooms to discover approaches taken, attitudes and perceptions held, and support given. These case studies can be used to help&nbsp;other newsrooms develop approaches to improving the access to&nbsp;and use of CAR techniques in their reporting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The continuing efforts of the conference participants and, we hope, others will bring each of these projects to life.</span></p><h4><a name="bookmark25"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">About this book</span></h4>
<p><span class="font12">This book of readings, a set of CAR autobiographies, is the work of the participants in the January conference. They were&nbsp;asked to write about their place in the evolution of CAR in their&nbsp;organizations and in their work as journalists. In this collection&nbsp;you will find their definitions of CAR, reminiscences of their&nbsp;discovery of CAR, recollections of favorite “How I got ’em”&nbsp;CAR stories, and hard-earned advice to beginners and seasoned&nbsp;journalists venturing into the use of these ways of reporting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">We start the essays with an appropriate chronicler of where CAR has been and where it is going - appropriate because, in&nbsp;many ways, CAR started with him. Phil Meyer, author of </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Precision Journalism</span><span class="font12"> and champion of the use of social science research techniques in reporting, begins the set of readings with a&nbsp;typically provocative essay, “The Future of CAR: Declare Victory and Get Out!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Next come essays by the people most involved in three of the foundations of CAR training and discussion: Brant Houston on&nbsp;NIC AR, Jim Brown on NIAR, and Elliot Parker on CARR-L.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">These are followed by personal histories by CAR pioneers and current practitioners who attended the conference. Essays&nbsp;from our three international participants, representing the CAR&nbsp;perspectives in Mexico, Denmark, and the Netherlands are next.&nbsp;Wrapping up are a trio of essays focusing on the CAR education&nbsp;and training needs of the past, present, and future.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">We hope these essays will give you a sense of where CAR has been, how it got to where it is, and what it needs to keep it going.&nbsp;We’d like you to join us in this effort to better understand and&nbsp;promote the techniques of computer assisted reporting into&nbsp;daily and project journalism.

<p><span class="font12">In 1991 Larry Sanders, then CAR editor at </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">USA Today,</span><span class="font12"> said, “It won’t be long before some government agencies will not be&nbsp;keeping paper data anymore. If newspapers are going to maintain their ‘watchdog-of-the-govemment’ role, they are going to&nbsp;eventually have to have access to electronic data as well as paper&nbsp;data.” That day has come.</span></p><div>

<p><span class="font12">An popular axiom about CAR is that it makes a good reporter better but it won’t make a bad reporter good. It’s not a magic&nbsp;bullet; it’s hard work. But it is work that can find and tell stories&nbsp;that you couldn’t find and tell otherwise.</span></p><h3><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font19">The Future of CAR: Declare Victory and Get Out!</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">By Philip Meyer</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The time has come to abandon “computer assisted reporting” - CAR. It’s an obsolete concept that is starting to get in the way&nbsp;of our understanding of the real battles that we need to fight and&nbsp;win if we are to save the soul of journalism.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">CAR is an embarrassing reminder that we are entering the 21st century as the only profession in which computer users feel&nbsp;the need to call attention to themselves. All of the other professions take computers for granted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">For example:</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">My cousin Bob Meyer is a retired accountant, and he uses a computer to audit the books of his boat club, the Marco Island&nbsp;Sail and Power Squadron. He doesn’t call himself a computer&nbsp;assisted accountant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">My daughter Melissa Meyer is an environmental designer in Coral Gables, Fla. She does her creative work on a computer.&nbsp;She doesn’t call herself a computer assisted designer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">My cousins Max and Richard Benne are farmers in St. Joseph County, Mich. They use computers to calculate depreciation on&nbsp;their equipment and to calibrate the fertilizer applications for&nbsp;their corn and soybean fields. They don’t call themselves&nbsp;computer assisted farmers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Let’s forget about the computer and start talking about, and organizing around, what we really want to do. Here’s what I&nbsp;think that is:</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Journalism today is in a battle for survival against the forces that would merge it with entertainment, advertising, and public&nbsp;relations. The information age has created such a confusing buzz&nbsp;of voices that it tempts us all to sacrifice almost anything for&nbsp;attention - including truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">What the practitioners of CAR have been after - whether consciously or not - is a higher standard of truthtelling. Our response to the information age has been to learn to manage&nbsp;larger bodies of information with increasingly powerful analytic&nbsp;tools, leading to a more exact definition of truth. As it happens, a&nbsp;computer is helpful in doing that. But the computer itself is not&nbsp;the goal, nor does it define what we are trying to do. We are trying to push journalism toward science. Almost everybody else, it&nbsp;seems on most days, is trying to push it toward ait.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Pushing journalism toward art can justify or mask the merger of reporting and advocacy. It can facilitate the entertainment&nbsp;function of journalism - and we should never deny that entertainment is one of our functions. It can lead to a subjective form&nbsp;of truth in the postmodernist, phenomenological sense. But it&nbsp;will not, in the long run, lead to the building of credibility and&nbsp;trust that journalism needs if it is to survive as an independent&nbsp;information specialty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">One response to information overload has been the elevation of spin. When attention-getting is more important than discovering and imparting the truth, the marketplace rewards those who&nbsp;are skilled at creating appearances. Our goal needs to be to find a&nbsp;way to help that marketplace reward the truth-tellers. The&nbsp;demand is a given. With so much effort devoted to crafty distor</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">tion, the market value of truth has to rise as a function of its scarce supply. All a media company has to do is find a way to&nbsp;brand it and sell it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Our little piece of this action should be the application of scientific method to the practice of journalism. We need to focus&nbsp;on the time-tested methods of overcoming wishful thinking,&nbsp;superstition, selective perception, and the other human frailties&nbsp;that hinder the acquisition of knowledge. We need to build a&nbsp;force in journalism that rewards critical thinking and the skeptical testing of conventional wisdom. Yes, the computer is a tool&nbsp;that can help us do that. But that’s all it is. Focus on the goal, and&nbsp;then we can take the computer for granted, as the farmers and&nbsp;accountants and designers already do.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">My first computer encounter was with the IBM 7090 at the Harvard Computation Center in 1966. Having failed miserably&nbsp;at two successive attempts to predict Ohio election outcomes for&nbsp;the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Akron Beacon Journal,</span><span class="font12"> I was using my Nieman year to study&nbsp;social science research methods. I started with a course for&nbsp;sophomores in which each student was allotted two minutes of&nbsp;the 7090’s CPU time. My 120 seconds produced several&nbsp;cross tabs and significance tests from a survey of junior college&nbsp;students, using Harvard Data-Text, a higher-level programming&nbsp;language that was the harbinger of Statistical Package for the&nbsp;Social Sciences (SPSS).</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">For the second semester, I did advanced work in a graduate course after negotiating a deal with Dwight Sargent, curator of&nbsp;the Nieman Foundation. He gave me $100 to buy computer time&nbsp;in exchange for writing an article for </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Nieman Reports.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">I was back on the job in the Knight Newspapers Washington bureau only a few weeks when the Detroit riot broke out, and I&nbsp;was dispatched to help the staff of the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Free Press.</span><span class="font12"> The call came&nbsp;at noon, and that night I was riding with the National Guard&nbsp;amid the burning buildings and sniper fire of 12th Street. When&nbsp;the shooting ended and the fires were out, I proposed a survey of&nbsp;the riot neighborhoods to discover the riot’s underlying causes,&nbsp;applying the principles I had just learned at Harvard.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Of course we used a computer to analyze the results. I recruited University of Michigan professors John Robinson and Nathan Caplan and computer programmer Judith Goldberg to&nbsp;help with the design and analysis. Goldberg did the crosstabs&nbsp;with Filter Tau, a program more primitive than Harvard’s but&nbsp;good enough. It ran on an IBM 360/40.</span></p><div>

<p><span class="font2">Phil Meyer teaches two courses each semester while coordinating the master's program in&nbsp;journalism at the University of North Carolina at&nbsp;Chapel Hill. He currently produces an occasional&nbsp;column of media criticism for </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">USA Today</span><span class="font2"> and&nbsp;researches current trends in newspaper&nbsp;journalism.</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
<p><span class="font12">The response to that project inspired a long-term commitment by me and my management to this new form of journalism -</span></p><div><img src="when-nerds-and-words-collide_files/when-nerds-and-words-collide-6.jpg" style="width:53pt;height:21pt;"/></div><br clear="all"/>
<p><span class="font12">defined not by the computer, but by the application of social science research methods to reporting. Executive editor Lee&nbsp;Hills later wrote to me that the survey was an important factor in&nbsp;the decision of the Pulitzer jury to give the 1968 prize for general local reporting to the staff of the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Free Press.</span><span class="font12"> The Kemer&nbsp;Commission called the survey one of the few “brilliant exceptions” to the generally dismal performance of the news media in&nbsp;covering riots.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">While based in Washington, I became a roving local reporter, helping members of Knight’s then-small group of newspapers&nbsp;with stories, mostly relating to the civil rights and anti-war&nbsp;movements, that needed bigger investigative power than conventional methods could muster.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The first description of this as computer reporting that I can remember was when a </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Newsweek</span><span class="font12"> profile in 1968 called me “a&nbsp;computer reporter.” The application of social science research&nbsp;methods was too complicated a frame. Computers were familiar,&nbsp;in concept if not in general use, and so that became the popular&nbsp;definition of what I was doing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">By this time, I was writing my own programs in Data-Text. Harvard had produced the software on a government grant and&nbsp;placed it in the public domain. I bought it for $10, the price of&nbsp;the 7-track tape. And I located several computer centers that offered 7090 or 7094 time at cut rates while the 360 generation of&nbsp;machines was capturing market share. My statistical skills&nbsp;increased. For a 1968 study of black attitudes in Miami, I used&nbsp;factor analysis to sort out the varieties of black militancy with&nbsp;guidance from CNN’s Bill Schneider, then a Harvard graduate&nbsp;student.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">In the 1969-1970 academic year, I took a leave of absence from Knight to write </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Precision Journalism</span><span class="font12"> with money from&nbsp;and under the watchful eye of The Russell Sage Foundation. The&nbsp;book covered polls, field experiments, and analysis of public&nbsp;records. The title was suggested by Everett Dennis, who had&nbsp;coined the expression to contrast with “the new journalism”&nbsp;being practiced by those who applied fiction techniques to&nbsp;reporting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">That led to another error in framing. Because my most visible work had been with various forms of survey research, precision&nbsp;journalism became identified primarily with polls. While more&nbsp;accurate than the computer frame, it still did not capture the&nbsp;broad sweep of the concept as described in the first chapter of&nbsp;the first edition of </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Precision Journalism.</span><span class="font12"> Polls, when done correctly, are part of scientific method, but the concept is meant to</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">cover all applicable forms of scientific method, including public records and experiments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">My first public records application came in 1972 when I took time out from election coverage to help Donald L. Barlett and&nbsp;James B. Steele with their criminal justice investigation. </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">The&nbsp;Philadelphia Inquirer</span><span class="font12"> was by then a Knight newspaper, and I&nbsp;worked out a coding scheme and rudimentary sample design,&nbsp;then wrote the analysis program in Data-Text. By that time, IBM&nbsp;7090 cost was down to $75 per hour - by the wall clock, not&nbsp;CPU time - and the three of us did the analytic work at a private&nbsp;computer center in suburban Maryland. In the tabloid reprint of&nbsp;their story (although not in the newspaper), Barlett and Steele&nbsp;included a sidebar crediting me with a “sophisticated computer&nbsp;analysis.” The criteria for distinguishing it from an unsophisticated computer analysis was not defined, but, once again, the&nbsp;computer was used to define the work. My field experiments&nbsp;came much later, after I switched to journalism education. At the&nbsp;University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill, I have sent student&nbsp;reporters into the field to measure the courtesy of motorists, the&nbsp;racial prejudice of pedestrians, underage alcohol sales, and the&nbsp;knowledge of pharmacists about the AIDS protection capabilities of different brands of condoms. In each case, we used&nbsp;computers without feeling the need to mention it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">To emphasize that what I was doing was social science as well as journalism, I did two things. I archived data, starting with the&nbsp;Detroit riot survey, with the Institute for Research in Social&nbsp;Science at Chapel Hill to make it available for secondary analysis by scholars and graduate students. And I found opportunities&nbsp;for my own scholarly publishing, starting with a reworking of&nbsp;my Miami civil rights stories for </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Public Opinion Quarterly&nbsp;</span><span class="font12">(33:2 1969).</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">After three decades, the time has come to move away from the CAR frame and toward a social science frame. I don’t know&nbsp;what label to substitute for CAR. “Precision journalism” sounds&nbsp;dated. We need something that captures the notion in a fresh&nbsp;way. As reporters, we seek to draw generalizations that have&nbsp;more power than anecdotes or casual interviewing. “Scientific&nbsp;journalism,” which is how one French translation of “precision&nbsp;journalism” comes out, sounds too pretentious.</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">5</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
<p><span class="font12">Whatever the new term, let’s give up on CAR. Computers are used in so many different ways, even in the newsroom, that it no&nbsp;longer defines us, if it ever did. The time has come to declare&nbsp;CAR victorious and move on to a fresher, more ambitious concept. We need it, and so does the world.</span></p><h3><a name="bookmark3"></a><span class="font19">Changes in Attitudes, Changes in Latitudes</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">By Brant Houston</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Computer assisted reporting (CAR) has been more of an evolution than a revolution. In the 10 years since the first CAR&nbsp;conference was held and two CAR institutes were started, there&nbsp;have been significant, but sometimes hard to see, changes.&nbsp;Among those changes:</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The acceptance of CAR as a integral part not only of&nbsp;projects reporting, but also of daily and beat reporting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A stunning increase in the demand for training seminars.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A substantial growth in the number of journalists using&nbsp;these techniques.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The development of a generally accepted curriculum and&nbsp;syllabus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spread of CAR to other countries, particularly in Scandinavia and Central and South America.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">While there continue to be doubts and fears among veteran journalists about the use of CAR, the resistance is weakening to&nbsp;software that allows a journalist to give depth and context to&nbsp;daily, beat, and project stories. Furthermore, the speed of&nbsp;reporting has increased with the advent of the World Wide Web,&nbsp;software that’s easier to use, and the availability of more databases online.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">But rather than dwell on generalities, I will use the National Institute for Computer Assisted Reporting (NICAR) as an example and mirror of the overall changes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The Missouri School of Journalism and CAR pioneer Elliot Jaspin created the institute in 1989. At that time, the institute&nbsp;was named the Missouri Institute for Computer Assisted Reporting (MICAR).</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Jaspin had built a national reputation for himself while at the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Providence Journal-Bulletin</span><span class="font12"> by learning to download and&nbsp;analyze information on computer tapes. Although he had won a&nbsp;Pulitzer Prize while he worked for a Pennsylvania daily years&nbsp;earlier, Jaspin had won no major awards for his CAR work. Yet&nbsp;magazine articles about the stories he culled from his data analysis attracted the attention of other investigative journalists.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Although Jaspin did not use traditional social science research methods (unlike another database reporting pioneer, Philip&nbsp;Meyer), his counting, summing, and comparing of information&nbsp;in databases resulted in hard-hitting exposes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">In addition to showing by example, Jaspin made a critical contribution while on a Freedom Forum Fellowship. On leave&nbsp;from the Providence paper, Jaspin teamed with a computer programmer, Daniel Woods, to develop software called 9-Track&nbsp;Express, which was a major technical breakthrough because it&nbsp;gave journalists an easier way to get information off computer&nbsp;tapes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">That innovation freed journalists from learning the more complex programming language required by mainframe computers and from having to find time and space on mainframes that were&nbsp;being primarily used at newspapers for payroll, advertising,&nbsp;marketing, and circulation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">When Jaspin arrived at the University of Missouri, he quickly</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">put together a series of one-week seminars for journalists eager to learn how to download data and analyze databases. Most of&nbsp;the journalists who came to Missouri were veteran investigative&nbsp;reporters who had been doing databases in hard copy - that is,&nbsp;creating and sorting index cards, looking for connections&nbsp;between campaign contributions and government contracts,&nbsp;searching through libraries and documents for patterns of waste,&nbsp;fraud, or racial disparity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Jaspin also began teaching a class in computer assisted reporting at Missouri and had graduate students write a newsletter, called </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Uplink,</span><span class="font12"> and create a database library that collected and&nbsp;distributed useful government databases.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The seminars, known as “boot camps,” generally had eight to 12 journalists or system administrators. The boot camps included&nbsp;lessons and lectures on computer tape downloading, database&nbsp;analysis using Structured Query Language, and understanding&nbsp;the roots of data, including how 0’s and 1 ’s combined to create&nbsp;the characters and numbers on a computer screen.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The boot camps were intellectually tough and sometimes frustrating for journalists who had little or no training in computer programming. But many of those who attended became&nbsp;the second wave of CAR pioneers. The successful boot campers&nbsp;returned to newsrooms, argued for hardware and software,&nbsp;produced in-depth stories, and set up training programs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Because Investigative Reporters and Editors Inc., a professional organization begun in 1975, had its offices just down the hall and because many new CAR journalists were IRE&nbsp;members, a natural association formed between MICAR and&nbsp;IRE. And when Jaspin left Missouri in 1992 because of a serious&nbsp;illness in his family, it was not surprising that the IRE executive&nbsp;director, Andy Scott, and other volunteers kept the seminars&nbsp;going while Missouri searched for a replacement.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Meanwhile, IRE board member Bill Dedman set out to obtain a grant for computer assisted reporting that would permit the seminars given at Missouri to be taken to other locations. In 1993,&nbsp;Dedman won a $225,000 grant for IRE from the Freedom Forum&nbsp;to take the seminars on the road. At the same time, IRE and the&nbsp;Missouri School of Journalism worked out an agreement that&nbsp;would make the institute a joint program of the school and IRE.</span></p><div><img src="when-nerds-and-words-collide_files/when-nerds-and-words-collide-7.jpg" style="width:67pt;height:85pt;"/>
<p><span class="font2">Brant Houston is executive director of IRE and an assistant professor at the University of&nbsp;Missouri School of Journalism. He was previously managing director of NICAR. A daily&nbsp;journalist for 17 years, he worked at </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Hartford Courant, The Kansas City Star,</span><span class="font2"> and several&nbsp;news organizations in the Boston area.</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
<p><span class="font12">In late 1993, IRE hired me as the managing director of the yet-unnamed institute, and in early 1994 several pieces of the&nbsp;program came together. After I arrived, I persuaded everyone to&nbsp;call the institute the National Institute for Computer Assisted&nbsp;Reporting (NICAR), so we could have a letterhead and have</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">something to call the program. I also hired an on-the-road trainer, Jennifer LaFleur, who was working part-time in the&nbsp;newsroom and part- time in the marketing department at the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">San&nbsp;Jose Mercury News.</span><span class="font12"> LaFleur was a Missouri alum, had worked&nbsp;with Jaspin, had been my partner at a 1990 boot camp, and&nbsp;majored both in journalism and computer science. Meanwhile,&nbsp;Richard Mullins, a self-taught computer expert who had worked&nbsp;at newspapers and the National Library of Money and Politics,&nbsp;was hired in early 1994 by the school of journalism to teach the&nbsp;classes that Jaspin had taught and to work with NICAR.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Joining us were Matt Reavy, a doctoral candidate at the school who had taught some of the seminars, and Drew Sullivan, a journalism graduate student with a background in engineering and&nbsp;computers. While rejuvenating the database library and newsletter, we began reshaping the syllabus for CAR. We also began&nbsp;collaborating with Phil Meyer at the University of North Carolina and James Brown at Indiana University, two main&nbsp;leaders in CAR in the academic world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Richard, Jennifer, and I realized that the syllabus for CAR in Missouri needed to be revamped and become more inclusive.&nbsp;Software had become easier to use, and different groups supporting one kind of software or another had popped up. (There&nbsp;actually were panels at an IRE conference that pitted spreadsheets against database managers, as though you could use only&nbsp;one kind of software.) More data were available on diskettes or&nbsp;online, and the online world was about to explode because of the&nbsp;World Wide Web.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Five years of experience also demonstrated that CAR could effectively be used for daily and beat stories if a journalist was&nbsp;well-trained and prepared. We also knew that CAR training&nbsp;needed to have a kinder and friendlier reputation if we were&nbsp;going to spread the word.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">After reviewing all the different methods of training at CAR conferences and programs, we basically stood the syllabus on its&nbsp;head. We decided to first show stories produced by CAR, so&nbsp;journalists could see it was worth learning new skills. Then we&nbsp;had cleaned and prepared data sets so journalists could learn&nbsp;software without being distracted by too many records. Then we&nbsp;talked about how to find databases, negotiate for them, and&nbsp;download or import them. And we showed them how to build a&nbsp;database if it didn’t exist.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Eventually, we realized we needed two versions of the syllabus - one for weeklong seminars, and one for shorter, on-the-road Raining. The second NICAR on-the-road trainer, Neil&nbsp;Reisner, helped expand our focused Internet training and bring&nbsp;more attention to daily- and beat-reporting uses of CAR.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Our third NICAR trainer, Sarah Cohen, brought a level of sophistication to practical uses of statistical methods that we had&nbsp;not had before.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">But no matter how we changed, each syllabus emphasized learning the three basic tools of CAR: online resources, spreadsheets, and database managers. Since then, we have developed a&nbsp;syllabus for database design and database cleaning, database administration, mapping, and, with Phil Meyer, statistical methods.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Some journalists told us when we began that there would be little demand for training, and the market would be saturated</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">quickly. They also said that newsrooms, both in print and broadcast, would not pay enough to keep the institute going. Instead, we have been conducting 40 to 50 seminars a year in Missouri&nbsp;and the rest of the United States since 1994, most frequently for&nbsp;$1,000 a day plus expenses. The overall syllabus and level of the&nbsp;seminars has increased in sophistication. With grants from the&nbsp;Freedom Forum and the Knight Foundation, we have increased&nbsp;our training for minority journalists, who recognized in 1994&nbsp;that they were being left out of the technological loop.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">With a grant from the Joyce Foundation, we have gathered campaign finance databases and started a training program in&nbsp;that area. With a grant from the Robert M. McCormick Tribune&nbsp;Foundation, we have initiated a major training effort in Central&nbsp;and South America.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">We also have put together joint seminars with the University of North Carolina, the Medill School of Journalism at Northwestern University, Columbia University, and the New York&nbsp;University, and we have held joint conferences with Jim Brown&nbsp;at Indiana University. Our seminars also have drawn journalists&nbsp;from Scandinavia, Central and South America, and other parts&nbsp;of Europe. We have been invited to conduct more training in&nbsp;Finland, Sweden, and Denmark. (Danish journalists formed&nbsp;their own NICAR-like organization last year.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">During the past five years, I have written two editions of my textbook, </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Computer Assisted Reporting: A Practical Guide,</span><span class="font12"> that&nbsp;gathered together what many of us had learned about training&nbsp;and provided at least one road map for classes in newsrooms and&nbsp;journalism schools.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">We estimate that more than 12,000journalists have been to our 300 conferences and seminars. Our database library does work&nbsp;for more than 130 news organizations a year. The number of students taking CAR at Missouri has grown from fewer than 10 to&nbsp;30. The number of graduate students at NICAR has increased&nbsp;from two to 10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Yet none of this means that the work is close to done.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">We know we need to provide training to editors and news directors so they can better understand and direct reporting that&nbsp;uses CAR and/or social science research techniques. We need to&nbsp;better tailor our training to the three tiers of journalists in a&nbsp;newsroom: end-users, who need quick answers based on searches of databases; power users, who want to do their own data&nbsp;analysis; and data crunchers, who not only do analysis but also&nbsp;download and clean more complicated databases.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Perhaps the most important lesson we trainers have learned is to keep focusing on the critical thinking that the use of the software demands. And perhaps this is the revolutionary realization&nbsp;of CAR that creates trepidation and resistance.</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">7</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
<p><span class="font12">Journalists need more sophisticated skills to report in the 21st century. Stenography won’t do. Stories based only on shallow&nbsp;and ill-documented disputes and conflicts won’t do. Careless&nbsp;use of statistics and numbers won’t do. And refusal to provide&nbsp;training in these skills won’t do. Without the training, journalists&nbsp;will not be able to distinguish themselves from information&nbsp;brokers, Internet pamphleteers, or casual purveyors of idle,&nbsp;vicious gossip and rumor.</span></p><h3><a name="bookmark26"></a><span class="font19">A Beginning Educational Effort</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">By James W. Brown</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The 1980s were characterized by a maturing of the desktop micro-computer. The Apple computer of the late 1970s, with the&nbsp;sloping front that looked like an amphibious landing vehicle,&nbsp;when paired with VisiCalc, the first spreadsheet, made inroads&nbsp;in the business world - especially small businesses. IBM, finally&nbsp;taking notice of micro-computing, introduced its first desktop&nbsp;model. That machine was my first personal computer. Buying&nbsp;hardware and software in the early 1980s was like being set&nbsp;afloat in the north woods of Canada in a leaky canoe, with&nbsp;broken paddles, and no food, matches, map, or GPS unit. You&nbsp;had to survive with your own wit and resources. If you were able&nbsp;to actually do something with a computer, you were deemed a&nbsp;“guru” or “nerd” by all who knew you. Computer stores were&nbsp;populated by salespeople who did not know anything about&nbsp;what they were selling. If you needed a connecting cable, you&nbsp;often had to make it. Software manuals were often mimeographed and were poorly written by the software designers and&nbsp;programmers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">That state of affairs was not all bad. Struggling through adversity teaches self-reliance. The poor quality of documentation led to a third-party industry of computer books. The success of the&nbsp;third-party book publishers encouraged more people to learn&nbsp;about computers, and so on. Early adopters were eager to help&nbsp;and support others seeking to learn. New “online communities”&nbsp;emerged. Networks of computer bulletin boards became popular&nbsp;venues for sharing knowledge and “shareware” software.</span></p><h4><a name="bookmark27"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Schneider arrives in a whirlwind</span></h4>
<p><span class="font12">In 1989, Andy Schneider became the Indiana University School of Journalism’s first occupant of the Riley Chair, a rotating chair that brings distinguished professionals to IU for shortterm appointments. Unlike his successors, Schneider decided to&nbsp;work on the Indianapolis campus rather than on the larger and&nbsp;older campus in Bloomington. That gave a tremendous boost to&nbsp;our young program and put the two of us in a direct working relationship.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The partnership was good for both of us. Our skills and interests complemented one another. In 1986 and 1987, Schneider was the lead reporter in projects that won back-to-back Pulitzer&nbsp;Prizes for public service and specialized reporting. He is a terrific journalist, but dealing with software and hardware problems&nbsp;was frustrating to him. Even though Schneider had used computers in more than half the stories he reported between 1986&nbsp;and 1990, he wrote, “I don’t really like computers. In fact, there&nbsp;are times when I absolutely hate the things.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">While a candidate for a master’s degree in business administration at Indiana University, I learned every nuance of the 80-column Hollerith punch card - which was based on technology used to tabulate the 1890 U.S. census. I could punch, sort, and&nbsp;submit them to the mainframe computers.<sup>1</sup> Rapid turnaround in&nbsp;those days was 30 minutes. You unfolded the printout only to&nbsp;learn that you had made a typographical or programming logic</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">error. You stood in line for the next available card punch machine, corrected the necessary cards, and resubmitted the deck. I spent too many hours punching those damn cards. Most of my&nbsp;programs were written in FORTRAN, and most everything I&nbsp;needed to do required an original program.</span></p><h4><a name="bookmark28"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">National Institute for Advanced Reporting</span></h4>
<p><span class="font12">The computer problems that made smoke rise from Schneider’s ears were interesting problems to me. We were&nbsp;super-additive troublemakers. We both knew computers were,&nbsp;even then, powerful tools. We noted that not many reporters</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">were using computers after the early success of Barlett and</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">2</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Steele, with Phil Meyer’s assistance, and others that followed. We decided to try to do something to educate journalists about&nbsp;this new tool. We formed the National Institute for Advanced&nbsp;Reporting (NIAR) and scheduled our first national conference&nbsp;for the spring of 1990 on the Indianapolis campus. About 400 reporters and editors from across the nation and four foreign countries came to the “Conference on Advanced Investigative Methods for Journalists,” which apparently was the first for working&nbsp;journalists.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) were co-sponsors of the first two conferences. IRE president Rick Tulsky wrote to&nbsp;introduce the 1990 conference, “The use of computers in&nbsp;research is an area that too few of us have mastered; hopefully,&nbsp;we will leave this weekend with more of us inclined to make use&nbsp;of the computer as a journalistic tool.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Ideas from that conference became models for professional training later used by the IRE National Institute for Computer&nbsp;Assisted Reporting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">It was common for editors to believe that computers for newsgathering would be much more expensive than they actually were. Some editors estimated that they would have to spend&nbsp;$10,000 or more to get a computer suitable for a reporter to use.&nbsp;Even in 1990, this was not the case. David Ashenfelter, of the&nbsp;</span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Detroit Free Press,</span><span class="font12"> did complex projects on an almost obsolete&nbsp;10-year-old Kaypro.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">In 1990, journalists in software training sessions did not know where the computer’s power switch was. Four years later, some&nbsp;of those same journalists were asking for sessions on Statistical</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">'a room-sized mainframe would use 64K memory for an SPSS run.</span></p><div><img src="when-nerds-and-words-collide_files/when-nerds-and-words-collide-8.jpg" style="width:67pt;height:85pt;"/>
<p><span class="font2">James W. Brown, Ph.D., is a professor and associate dean of the Indiana School of Journalism at Indianapolis. He has published research in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Public&nbsp;Opinion Quarterly</span><span class="font2"> and pictures in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">National Geographic.</span><span class="font2"> With Andy Schneider, he formed the&nbsp;National Institute for Advanced Reporting in&nbsp;1989 and offered the first professional education&nbsp;conferences on computer analysis as a reporting&nbsp;tool.</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
<p><span class="font2">A survey we conduted in September 1989 indicated fewer than 60 of the nation’s newsrooms were actively involved in using computers to gather and evaluate data&nbsp;for news stories.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS). Mike Berens, of the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Chicago Tribune,</span><span class="font12"> is an example of the positive influence of the&nbsp;conferences. He progressed from learner to trainer, leading practitioner, main session speaker, and international trainer. (See&nbsp;Berens’s essay on page 14.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">In the spring of 1990, Schneider and I offered Indiana University’s first course in computer assisted reporting. Two-thirds of the students were working TV and newspaper reporters. Each&nbsp;week we were astounded at the new applications those students&nbsp;found for newsgathering. One project on medical malpractice&nbsp;that grew out of the course won the Pulitzer Prize for Joe Halli-nan and Susan Heddon of </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">The Indianapolis Star.</span><span class="font12"> That wasn’t&nbsp;bad for the first offering of a new course.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">After the 1990 conference, Schneider went back to the world of journalism. The NIAR staff continued to host five more conferences, which put an increasing dent in the small academic&nbsp;budget of the School of Journalism at Indianapolis. In the meantime, Brant Houston had built an excellent infrastructure and&nbsp;staff at NICAR. They offered boot camps of weeklong immersion compared with our two and half days of basic introduction.&nbsp;While something of a competitive nature emerged between&nbsp;NIAR and NICAR in the early days, we evolved into a cooperative and supportive venture. Indeed, Houston and his staff were&nbsp;very helpful to us in conducting our last several conferences.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The work and worry associated with preparation for a technology-rich conference is immense. The small NIAR staff was exhausted after the six conferences. Faced with the certain resignation of 100 percent of my staff if I proposed to host a seventh&nbsp;conference, I decided six was enough.</span></p><h4><a name="bookmark29"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Concerns for the future</span></h4>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Newspapers: </span><span class="font12">I have not, over the years, noticed any great concern on the part of newspaper management to further the&nbsp;intellectual development of their employees. This may sound&nbsp;harsh, but I know of too many examples that give evidence to&nbsp;the contrary. Many reporters attending our conference not only&nbsp;paid their own way but had to take vacation time as well. I find&nbsp;this situation outrageous. It seems reporters are treated much&nbsp;more as production line workers than educated professionals.&nbsp;But even that analogy fails because I know that coiporations&nbsp;spend a great deal of money training production line workers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Newspaper management needs a paradigm shift or a swift kick in the pants. News organizations need to start encouraging&nbsp;professional education. Reporter education and support is an&nbsp;investment to ensure continued importance of newsgathering in&nbsp;our democracy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Television: </span><span class="font12">Newton Minnow really did peg the industry correctly in the 1960s when he termed television a vast wasteland. Very few reporters of substance exist in television. Television, as&nbsp;an industry, does not provide paid student internships, nor does&nbsp;the industry supply college scholarships. They get what they pay&nbsp;for. While there are exceptions, not much of substance has been&nbsp;done with computers as a reporting tool. Stations are more likely&nbsp;to spend money on double Doppler radar than on support for reporting. While weather forecasting has improved, the quality of</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">reporting has declined since the early days of television.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">TV managers need to think seriously about whether they have the will to produce anything beyond entertainment. Television&nbsp;used to inform us about important issues. What happened and&nbsp;what can they do with the time Seinfeld has vacated?</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Higher education: </span><span class="font12">Curricula do not change rapidly. Political processes and factions on many faculties rival that of Congress&nbsp;in an impeachment trial. A convincing case for change is not&nbsp;made overnight. As journalism schools have evolved from&nbsp;having trade-school reputations that were not respected by other&nbsp;faculty in the university, there has been a growing slight of tool&nbsp;skills in favor of courses that fit more squarely into the university fabric. Faculty reward structures do not typically reinforce&nbsp;learning new skills and teaching them. Most faculty were practicing journalists when CAR was something you drive. Faculty&nbsp;don’t teach what they don’t know. And so it goes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">I hope that CAR training will become a required experience for all journalism students everywhere. It may take awhile to get&nbsp;there, although clearly progress has been made. I have noticed&nbsp;that basic training in spreadsheets and relational databases is&nbsp;very commonly available in other majors. Thus, journalism students are likely to be exposed to basic tool skills somewhere in&nbsp;their education, if not in the journalism major.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">But training in the journalism major can bring many elements together so they make sense. Software training is not sufficient.&nbsp;Formulating the problem is much more important. Teaching the&nbsp;mechanical basics of SPSS is trivial and doesn’t take much time.&nbsp;Knowing which statistic to use with a particular data set is the&nbsp;real problem. SPSS is useless without a background in statistics.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">I consulted with a journalist on a problem that had become worrisome to him. He was concerned with a 90-year-old truck&nbsp;driver who was considerably older than the other drivers in the&nbsp;sample. He wondered whether the age had been incorrectly entered in the database he had obtained. He was worried that this&nbsp;“outlier” would skew the mean age of the sample. I asked how&nbsp;big the sample was. He said 105,000 drivers. He had not yet reasoned the effect of one person on the mean age in a sample of&nbsp;105,000 persons is very, very insignificant. In other words, a little knowledge can be dangerous - or at least worrisome.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Statistics, taught with journalism examples and integrated with CAR techniques, is best done in journalism school. CAR is no&nbsp;less important a skill than interviewing, writing, layout, design,&nbsp;visual communication and so on. We don’t need to eliminate core&nbsp;courses. CAR can be effectively integrated in almost any course.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The important link is for the faculty to recognize its importance and to acquire the experience to teach it. These are basic tools to try to make sense of things. I will always be perplexed&nbsp;that journalism schools did not provide leadership in integrating&nbsp;analysis techniques into the curriculum. Business schools did.&nbsp;And they grew from “trade-school” reputations as well.</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">9</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
<p><span class="font12">IRE/NICAR continues the professional education effort. I expect no drop in the need for education in the next decade.&nbsp;Thinking about numbers and what they mean should become as&nbsp;much a part of journalists minds as concern for words and what&nbsp;they mean. It is an achievable goal.</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font19">The View from the Backshop</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">By Elliott Parker</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The “virtual newsroom” for journalists, the electronic mail list for Computer Assisted Reporting and Research (CARR-L),&nbsp;went online in October 1992. The seeds of an idea of a cyberplace like CARR-L had been planted four years before at a Gannett Technology Seminar in New York.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Participants were asked to develop an idea for some sort of journalistic, technological project. At the time, the idea of computer-based communication was still new. My introduction to&nbsp;computers, in the undergraduate world of the 1950s, consisted of&nbsp;learning how to set switches on the console and load card readers. Engineering students were still walking around with slide&nbsp;rules. After working for several years in Vietnam as a photo-joumalist for daily newspapers and UPI, I returned to school. I&nbsp;did the grad student/junior faculty thing and used computers for&nbsp;content-analytical studies and as a database for a book on Asian&nbsp;journalism.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">By 1985,1 discovered some journalists were already congregating on The WELL (Whole Earth ’Lectronic Link), in San Francisco, but this meant a long-distance call to connect with a&nbsp;UNIX-based system interface that even then was not very easy&nbsp;to use. A few journalists were also using sections on commercial&nbsp;services such as The Source and CompuServe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">My idea for the Gannett seminar was for some sort of electronic bulletin board system (BBS) where the journalists in the trenches could get help and support in this arcane new medium.&nbsp;At the time, few, if any, newspapers or stations had any outside&nbsp;network connection. A few universities and research organizations were connected through Bitnet, but any broad connection&nbsp;between self-contained networks was still in the dreaming stage.&nbsp;The BBS seemed to be the way to go.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">At NIAR in 1992,1 met many journalists using computers for many different purposes who individually felt they were working in a vacuum. The conference itself was mainly devoted to&nbsp;number-crunching. Aside from a mention of Delphi, The&nbsp;Source, Peacenet/IGC, and some BBSs in a handout, computer&nbsp;communication, in general, was still minimally used.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Bitnet was a network started by a consortium of universities to expand communication between faculty and researchers. One&nbsp;of the concepts the consortium developed was the idea of a “list&nbsp;server.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The list server would handle all the computer administration tasks of a given group of people. People would “subscribe” to a&nbsp;specific “list” of people with a common interest on a machine&nbsp;and the handling of the subscription would be taken care of by&nbsp;the computer. Given the scarcity of network resources, the&nbsp;program was optimized to run over a network of IBM mainframe computers, which most universities used at the time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Eric Thomas, a student in Paris, wrote the code for the first version of Revised Listserv that forms the basis of the current&nbsp;commercial Listserv program. Other mail list management&nbsp;programs such as Majordomo and ListProc would later copy the&nbsp;idea.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">For four years, I assumed somebody would see what a good idea it might be to connect journalists.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Finally, after some online discussion, CARR-L went online in October 1992. It was to be a “virtual newsroom” where journalists could hang out, ask questions, and get up to speed on the&nbsp;“new” technology. Casting about for an organization to host the&nbsp;new list, Jim Cocks, the senior academic consultant at the University of Louisville, offered to set up the list there. After some&nbsp;discussion, the list was named CARR-L.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Just CAR-L was felt to be too limiting. At the time, most journalists first thought of number-crunching when computer&nbsp;assisted reporting was mentioned; but the list was seen as a place&nbsp;for all sorts of journalistic concerns with computers, whether&nbsp;data crunching or communication. Librarians and researchers&nbsp;also were becoming more directly involved with the news operation, so the idea of “research” was included.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">CAJ-L was suggested, but Nora Paul at The Poynter Institute thought it might be pronounced too much like “cackle”; so&nbsp;CARR-L was chosen to reinforce the idea of “reporting and&nbsp;research.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Several foci were emphasized. First, CARR-L would be for working journalists; JOURNET (now JOURNET-L) was&nbsp;already online for journalism educators. This was not to denigrate educators and students, but to focus on the different&nbsp;concerns of the working journalist. During the working day,&nbsp;journalists generally have little time for peripheral chitchat and&nbsp;extended philosophical discussion. As an early message said,&nbsp;“We’ve got a paper to get out tomorrow.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">On the other hand, the list is “open” so anybody can subscribe, recognizing that some “working journalists” may be&nbsp;taking classes and some students may be turning out a lot of&nbsp;copy for publication. But CARR-L was never seen as a general&nbsp;discussion list for the state of journalism or a general discussion&nbsp;place for students working on term papers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Discussion on CARR-L tends to focus on solving particular questions. Recently the questions have ranged from:</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How do I convert a PDF file to something I can use in a&nbsp;spreadsheet?</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where can I find current data on child poverty?</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are the best news sites?</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How do I FTP sound files?</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How do I check my ZIP drive for the “click of death”?</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are some good CAR sites in Europe?</span></p><div><img src="when-nerds-and-words-collide_files/when-nerds-and-words-collide-9.jpg" style="width:67pt;height:85pt;"/>
<p><span class="font2">Elliott Parker is an associate professor of journalism at Central Michigan University and&nbsp;has taught at the National University of Malaysia&nbsp;on a Fulbright professorship and Temple University. Parker started the e-mail list Computer&nbsp;Assisted Reporting and Research (CARR-L) in&nbsp;1992. He also ''owns&quot; the e-mail list for Southeast Asian studies (SEASIA-L), and the national&nbsp;press photographers (NPPA-L).</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
<p><span class="font12">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where can I find online shopping statistics?</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Announcements range from job openings and a site for online hoaxes to Department of Justice reports on substance abuse and&nbsp;Asian corporate information.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">In typical Internet fashion, good statistics are difficult to obtain, but it is probably safe to say CARR-L has several thousand journalists and editors from at least 54 countries. Although&nbsp;Canada and the United States represent about 75 percent of the&nbsp;subscribers, others come from Iran, Singapore, and Australia.&nbsp;The number of journalists from Europe is increasing steadily.&nbsp;Several writers have used subscribers in other countries as&nbsp;sources for story backgrounds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">One of the major advantages of an e-mail list like CARR-L, compared with a World Wide Web interface, is the ability of&nbsp;anybody in the world with some kind of network connection to&nbsp;subscribe to the list. E-mail is the lowest common denominator&nbsp;on the Internet, requiring minimal network and computer&nbsp;resources.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">CARR-L seems to have matured. It has evolved from the enthusiastic first stages of a list, through the confusion of just&nbsp;what the list is “about,” to a certain stability.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">It has remained a place where journalists can get answers to questions and try out story ideas and techniques. A sense of&nbsp;community has evolved among the subscribers, along with a&nbsp;feeling of ownership of “my” list. Generally, when a topic or&nbsp;discussion strays too far afield, subscribers let the offender&nbsp;know. It remains heavily populated by working journalists and&nbsp;news librarians with an admixture of public relations practitioners. CARR-L remains a support group for those who are not in&nbsp;locations with physical connections with other journalists.</span></p><h4><a name="bookmark30"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">CARR-L on campus</span></h4>
<p><span class="font12">Sitting on the academic side, and using the computer resources of an academic institution to support CARR-L, it&nbsp;remains surprising that, with the installed electronic, networking, and academic infrastructure, schools and departments of&nbsp;journalism have been so slow and reluctant to move into new&nbsp;technology. Even within the academy, where journalism might&nbsp;be expected to embrace new technology as a means of communication, other disciplines are leading the way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Computer assisted reporting education at the university level has a spotty and variable history.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">In the 1980s, following the lead of most newspapers, most departments and schools of journalism were reluctant to commit&nbsp;resources to this new method of communication. Many remembered the experiments of the previous decade, such as Viewtron,&nbsp;and decided to “wait it out and see what happens.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">As it became more obvious the world was undergoing not a computer revolution (that had already happened), but a communication revolution, some universities began to develop courses,&nbsp;not just for data analysis, but for online acquisition and analysis&nbsp;of information. Computer assisted reporting remains, however,&nbsp;very unevenly distributed across the academic landscape for a&nbsp;variety of reasons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">In general, there is a considerable sense of inertia. Senior faculty, who tend to have the leadership role, see little reason to&nbsp;change, and those who do perceive some advantage run up&nbsp;against lack of support from other faculty and administrators.&nbsp;Many just do not have the time to learn a continually changing&nbsp;subject, even though many do have at least one statistics course&nbsp;in their background. And, of course, many suffer from number-and computer-phobia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Junior faculty, who might be expected to bring in new ideas, are unwilling to devote time or effort to a project or subject that will&nbsp;not count toward tenure or promotion decisions. Tom Johnson&nbsp;characterized this as the “fraud of journalism education” (“The&nbsp;Unconscious Fraud of Journalism Education,” </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Quill,</span><span class="font12"> June 1992).</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">There is also a feeling that students just entering the journalism education pipeline will come with a knowledge of&nbsp;“computers.” Unfortunately, computer games and good hand-eye coordination are not much of a basis for computer assisted&nbsp;reporting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Ideally, CAR would be integrated into all classes in a journalism curriculum so CAR becomes just another journalistic&nbsp;tool. In practice, the complexity of today’s computers means a&nbsp;few specific classes taught by interested faculty will integrate&nbsp;computer use. The majority of students will have a separate&nbsp;course, as more universities see the need for trained students,&nbsp;perhaps through the prism of CARR-L.</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">11</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
<p><span class="font12">Hopefully, even though the emphasis will remain on the needs of the practicing professional, CARR-L will remain a virtual&nbsp;newsroom where academics and working journalists can discuss&nbsp;how to use computers to “commit better journalism.”</span></p><h3><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font19">Put Your Career in the Fast Lane with CAR</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">By Paul Adrian</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">I found out about computer assisted reporting (CAR) after being a reporter for half a decade. At the time, I thought I knew a&nbsp;lot about how to do my job, but that changed in 1993 when I&nbsp;learned there was an important reporting skill that I knew next to&nbsp;nothing about. I discovered this at the National Institute of Computer Assisted Reporting’s (NICAR) fust national computer&nbsp;conference in Raleigh, N.C. This may sound like a cliche, but&nbsp;that weekend changed my life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">When I left the conference, I didn’t know exactly how to use a computer for research, but I got a taste of what CAR could add&nbsp;to my reporting. It felt like I had done all my reporting in a 10-by-10-foot room, and then someone walked to a window that I&nbsp;hadn’t noticed, opened it, and said, “You know, you can do&nbsp;stories out here also.” I looked out to find a world I had missed, a&nbsp;world full of stories CAR would help me find.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">What did I learn? Well, let’s start with what I already knew. Every government agency collects information all the time.&nbsp;That’s no big mystery, because every reporter uses information&nbsp;collected and stored by government agencies. We get the&nbsp;information one record at a time, as we need it for stories. With&nbsp;computer assisted reporting, you no longer ask for one record,&nbsp;you ask for every record. “Put it all on a disk,” you can tell an&nbsp;agency, “so I can look at it on my own computer at my own&nbsp;speed.” This gives the reporter the power to do his own research.&nbsp;No longer does he depend on the agency he’s investigating to do&nbsp;the work for him. How many times in your career have you discovered something and wondered, “Is this just a fluke or a widespread problem?” CAR helps you answer that question. It also&nbsp;helps you hold officials’ feet to the fire. When they dismiss your&nbsp;question by saying, “That one just fell through the cracks,” you&nbsp;can come back at them and say, “Actually, we looked at the&nbsp;records and found 46 more examples of the same thing.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">OK, I can hear some of you saying, “Cut the hyperbole. You’re sounding like one of those get-rich-quick guys on an&nbsp;infomercial.” I apologize if I sound that way, but the truth is that&nbsp;computer assisted reporting has been a boon to me. Since&nbsp;starting my computer training, I’ve accepted two full-time&nbsp;investigative reporting jobs, my salary has more than doubled,&nbsp;and most importantly, I’ve produced the best stories of my life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">For me, deciding whether I should learn how to use computers to research stories was a no-brainer. I felt you had to do it. It seemed clear that developing even rudimentary skills would&nbsp;allow a reporter to begin to produce significant stories he&nbsp;couldn’t find in any other way. So, why on earth are there so few&nbsp;television journalists who effectively use computers in their&nbsp;reporting? Here are the reasons I hear all the time, and my&nbsp;response for those of you who may be struggling with these issues in your newsroom.</span></p><h4><a name="bookmark31"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The excuses</span></h4>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">■ Computer-generated stories don’t make good television stories. </span><span class="font12">I want to do stories about people, not numbers. My</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">response: Don’t blame the computer for bad writing. If you focus on sterile aspects of a story, you’ll get a sterile story. Use&nbsp;the numbers generated by your analysis to build a foundation for&nbsp;your story, but don’t focus on the numbers exclusively.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">A lot of times I will boil a mountain of research down to a line or two in the script, but that one line forms the backbone of my&nbsp;story. Then, just like with any other story, I concentrate on storytelling, which means finding people. Since I have thousands of&nbsp;records at my fingertips, I find dramatic examples that I&nbsp;wouldn’t have found without the computer’s help. For instance,&nbsp;I once got pictures of an emergency medical technician with five&nbsp;drunken driving convictions on his record who was driving an&nbsp;ambulance. His employer didn’t know about the driving record&nbsp;that the computer allowed me to find. I found a principal and a&nbsp;teacher working in Ohio schools who had both been previously&nbsp;jailed for sexual assaults on students. I discovered them because&nbsp;the computer could quickly sort through half a million records.&nbsp;For another story, I found a man who got a $300,000 loan from&nbsp;the city even though he owed local government more than&nbsp;$40,000 in property taxes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Using a computer to research stories takes too long. I&nbsp;have to turn a story today. </span><span class="font12">True, doing a computer assisted&nbsp;project can take a long time. But I urge news directors to realize&nbsp;investing time on the front end can mean many payoffs in the&nbsp;long run. I collect data for almost all of the time-consuming&nbsp;projects I work on, but then I keep the data and make it available&nbsp;to the newsroom as a reference tool for quick-turn stories. For&nbsp;example, I once obtained a database of crime reports from the&nbsp;Columbus police department to use on a project. For months&nbsp;after my story aired, we used the database to add context to daily&nbsp;crime stories that the station covered. When a murder happened,&nbsp;we could look at the data and say it happened in a very dangerous neighborhood, much worse than the typical Columbus&nbsp;neighborhood. That way we didn’t needlessly scare viewers&nbsp;with the idea that the whole city was crime infested.</span></p><div><img src="when-nerds-and-words-collide_files/when-nerds-and-words-collide-10.jpg" style="width:67pt;height:85pt;"/>

Previously&nbsp;Paul spent two and a half years as an investigative reporter at WBNS-TV in Columbus,&nbsp;Ohio, where he used computer assisted&nbsp;reporting to build the foundation for numerous&nbsp;stories.</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You have to purchase a lot of equipment to do a computer assisted story, and I can’t get my boss to buy me a new&nbsp;pack of pencils, much less a high-powered computer. </span><span class="font12">With&nbsp;the price of computer equipment dropping, cost is not an excuse.&nbsp;You can get a computer for $2,000 today that CAR reporters&nbsp;could only dream about five years ago. So even if you have to&nbsp;buy your own equipment (and initially a lot of CAR reporters&nbsp;did just that), that’s not a good enough excuse to avoid learning&nbsp;these skills. However, any news director who doesn’t equip his</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">staff with good computers should be ashamed. When every photographer carries around $50,000 to $60,000 in camera gear,&nbsp;it’s not too much to ask administrators to spend a few thousand&nbsp;dollars on each reporter’s computer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You have to do a lot of training to use a computer, and&nbsp;I’m too old to learn new tricks. </span><span class="font12">I compare the fear of learning&nbsp;how to use computers to the fear of learning a foreign language.&nbsp;Fear keeps you from doing it. If you go to a foreign country for a&nbsp;couple of weeks, pretty quickly you’ll pick up enough of the&nbsp;language to communicate. Likewise, I highly recommend that&nbsp;reporters go to NICAR’s total immersion computer boot camp.&nbsp;You won’t know everything about computers after going, but&nbsp;you will develop the confidence you need to begin working on&nbsp;stories. It’s important to know that you don’t need to have some&nbsp;advanced data analysis degree to research a story. If you learn a&nbsp;few basic skills, you can start working on stories immediately.&nbsp;As you use those skills to turn stories, you’ll find yourself&nbsp;picking up many new skills.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can hire a computer expert to do the analysis for me.&nbsp;There’s no reason for me to learn how to do this. </span><span class="font12">How often&nbsp;have you actually ended up with the same story you started out&nbsp;with? I start with a general idea for a story, but as I do my&nbsp;research, I often find that it changes and I end up with something&nbsp;quite different. If you give the work to someone else, he’ll do&nbsp;exactly what you asked him to do, but he won’t look at the information with a reporter’s eye. As a result, you might miss out on&nbsp;finding the story.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">For example, I once did a story on certified medics with crimes on their records. One day, as I was studying the EMT&nbsp;database, I stumbled across a medic who listed a prison as his&nbsp;address. When I researched it, I found that this guy was in prison&nbsp;because of sexual assaults on two boys. Upon arriving at prison,&nbsp;he filled out a change of address form and sent it to the division&nbsp;of EMS. They dutifully changed his address but didn’t revoke&nbsp;his license. They assumed he worked at the prison and never&nbsp;considered the fact that he might be an inmate. I most likely&nbsp;would have missed finding him if someone else had been doing&nbsp;my data analysis.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Internet is untrustworthy. It’s not a good place for&nbsp;a reporter to find information for a story. </span><span class="font12">Although I have&nbsp;mainly been discussing using the computer for data analysis, the&nbsp;Internet is another powerful tool used by computer assisted&nbsp;reporters. Unfortunately, at almost every conference I attend, I&nbsp;hear someone say he wouldn’t trust the Internet as a source for&nbsp;information. The Internet is like any other source a reporter uses.&nbsp;The reporter should make sure he knows where the information&nbsp;is coming from and should never part with his protective cynicism. That being said, I would sure hate to handicap myself by&nbsp;throwing away the Internet. In so doing, I would also be&nbsp;throwing away thousands of official government websites (such&nbsp;as the Ohio site that puts every state law at your fingertips) and&nbsp;millions of print stories done by hundreds of papers across the&nbsp;country. The Internet contains fact and fiction, just as books do;&nbsp;it’s our job as reporters to determine which is which.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">It is with trepidation that I cite reasons why journalists should learn about computer assisted reporting. Citing reasons implies&nbsp;there is a choice. I don’t think there </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">is</span><span class="font12"> a choice. Television</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">journalists who refuse to start picking up the skills of computer assisted reporting will one day find themselves left far behind,&nbsp;and not just by other reporters.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Our industry is changing before our eyes. For a moment. I’m going to step away from computer research and talk about the&nbsp;distribution of our product. Most reporters (and managers) in the&nbsp;television industry have given little thought to how our product&nbsp;is distributed. They take for granted that broadcast television&nbsp;will be around forever.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Before your eyes glaze over with this topic, ask yourself what you would be doing if local television suddenly ceased to exist.&nbsp;While that may not happen completely, television will almost&nbsp;certainly change dramatically in the next few years, and it may&nbsp;not change the way we want it to. After the November 1998&nbsp;ratings period, the number one question at stations across the&nbsp;country wasn’t, “Who’s number one?” It was, “Where are our&nbsp;viewers going?” They’re leaving broadcast television, which&nbsp;means advertising budgets likely will begin to dwindle. If that&nbsp;happens, you can bet news budgets will be cut.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">We know why our viewers are leaving us. They’re going to cable and to the Internet. But we haven’t decided how we’re&nbsp;going to adjust our skills and product so we can continue to exist&nbsp;in this new media environment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">That brings us back to computer assisted reporting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Using this skill allows us to generate unique and hard-hitting content for daily stories as well as for in-depth projects. If&nbsp;there’s a bad rap on television, it’s that we’re shallow. We’re&nbsp;great at live shots and fast-paced stories, but we’re often murky&nbsp;on the details. When news consumers of the future are deciding&nbsp;where to go to for credible information, carrying the label&nbsp;“shallow” will kill us. What we need more than anything else is&nbsp;great content that consumers will trust. Computer assisted&nbsp;reporting will help us develop that content and credibility.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">For daily stories, we can survey the resources of the Internet and the millions of print stories that exist there to help find&nbsp;context for our stories. We can also use in-house databases to&nbsp;make us better and quicker at doing our jobs. For instance, a&nbsp;state payroll database might lead us to an employee involved in&nbsp;a scandal on the day the scandal breaks - when people in his office won’t even talk to us. For big stories, data analysis projects&nbsp;give us depth normally unseen on television. Finally, the more&nbsp;stories we do based on research of databases, the more interactive information we can offer to our viewers on the Internet,&nbsp;which will help us build credibility in a medium other than television.</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">13</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
<p><span class="font12">So how do we get there? I believe news organizations need to make commitments to begin training eveiy content-producing&nbsp;employee in basic computer assisted reporting. That only&nbsp;sounds scary because we think of computer assisted reporters as&nbsp;specialists with a great deal of computer knowledge. We need to&nbsp;get past that attitude and start thinking about CAR as a tool all&nbsp;reporters should have on their tool belt. It’s a skill, like interviewing or researching or writing, that can help any good&nbsp;reporter become a better reporter. We shouldn’t all become&nbsp;specialists, but we should all understand the basics of using a&nbsp;computer to help research our stories.</span></p><h3><a name="bookmark32"></a><span class="font19">The Myth of the Machine</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">By Michael J. Berens</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">It was the darkest of nights in a windowless room when the source, perched on my desk, quietly delivered a stunning revelation: City police officers owned crack houses. Years later, the&nbsp;source imparted another gem: A serial killer was trolling truck&nbsp;stops in five states for female victims. Most recently, and still&nbsp;going strong after a facelift, my confidant divulged that Chicago&nbsp;nursing homes were secret dumping grounds for violent state&nbsp;psychiatric patients.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">For the last decade, there has been no other exhilarating and exasperating source as my computer, a modern-day Siren whose&nbsp;seductive call leads to journalistic ecstasy - or certain ruin for&nbsp;the unwary.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">We call it computer assisted reporting, CAR for short. There are impressive self-help books and manuals wrapped with&nbsp;sample disks, training classes touting chi squares to regression&nbsp;analysis, self-described gurus who’ve become data gods, and&nbsp;reporters who possess more electronic equipment than common&nbsp;sense. Obscured behind the techno-babble is a simple truth: The&nbsp;best computer assisted reporting is bom from the heart, not the&nbsp;machine.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Critics often charge that CAR represents a barrier to good storytelling. There are no shortages of examples to confirm this&nbsp;fear. Of course, the telephone has been used for bad stories, too;&nbsp;skeptics are not shunning </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">that</span><span class="font12"> journalism tool. The best computer assisted reporting is invisible within the narrative, a hidden&nbsp;backbone that authoritatively supports the story. A random&nbsp;sample of this country’s best journalism will, more often than&nbsp;not, reveal the role of computer assisted research.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">It helps to envision the computer as a person, someone with frailties and faults, a woefully naive child who only repeats what&nbsp;it has been told, but possessing an innocence that can spot simple truths. Stories are unlocked by penetrating questions, not by&nbsp;the capacity of the Pentium chip. Vision, intuition, and imagination should combine bits and bytes into words that cause the&nbsp;reader to bolt into anger or shed a tear.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">More than a decade ago, I owned nothing more than a boxy Macintosh Plus and a piece of accounting software, Microsoft&nbsp;Excel. The resulting stories still stand tall today. Vice squad&nbsp;officers who got drunk on duty, juvenile prisoners raped by state&nbsp;guards, police informants who framed innocent citizens - these&nbsp;stories resulted from filling in blanks of little Excel squares, resembling blank graph paper on the screen. It was a&nbsp;valuable lesson: Start simple.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">All I had to do was fill in the blanks. This was something I could understand. And the computer could reorganize the information in ways that seemed, well, magical. I would stare at the&nbsp;information for hours. I looked for patterns and anomalies,&nbsp;sorting and re-sorting to my every whim. Later came the&nbsp;realization that I was interviewing the data just as I would any&nbsp;other source.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Do most nursing homes mix young psychiatric patients with elderly residents? Is it normal for police cruisers to crash in half</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">of all high-speed pursuits? How many fugitives are secretly released because police don’t want to pay for extradition?</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Following analysis of a court database, I determined that 90 percent of domestic violence cases were eventually dismissed.&nbsp;Some might jump at this lead, trumpet the computer findings,&nbsp;snag a few prosecutor quotes, touch base with victim advocates,&nbsp;and mix it all into an instant story. This would be a CAR failure.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Why were there so many dismissals? Again, ask the computer for clues. Dismissals were typically granted during arraignment&nbsp;hearings, computer analysis showed. Arraignment hearings are&nbsp;held with 24 hours of the crime. What the heck was going on? A&nbsp;visit to the hearings provided the answers: Cases were automatically dismissed if victims could not make it to the hearing, even if&nbsp;they had no transportation or had been hospitalized just hours before. If victims did show, they were required to stand just feet&nbsp;away from their attacker, an intimidating requirement for some&nbsp;women who fled in tears. Some male judges unmercifully grilled&nbsp;female victims who asked for protection orders. Traditional reporting skills still create the outer covering, the contour, and the&nbsp;texture. The resulting human stories were a CAR success.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The myth of the machine hit home in the early 1990s when a Cable News Network crew visited the newsroom to film a&nbsp;segment on how I documented the existence of a possible serial&nbsp;killer. Using a spreadsheet program, I tracked the unsolved&nbsp;deaths of women whose bodies were found along highways. The&nbsp;computer was a significant tool, but breakthroughs occurred&nbsp;through interviews and leaked law enforcement documents.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">“How did you do the story?” the producer asked. My answers stressed old-fashioned legwork coupled with the power of the&nbsp;computer. My answer was unsatisfactory. Surely I discovered&nbsp;some sort of technological alchemy; perhaps a complex mathematical formula was employed, no? The producer was sure that I&nbsp;was trying to be modest. “Come on,” she said. “You can tell us&nbsp;how you really did it.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Later, the FBI invited me to Quantico, Va., to explain how my trusty Macintosh outmatched the bureau’s mainframes, which&nbsp;were programmed to spot pattern crimes. It’s not the size of the&nbsp;computer, but the human behind it that matters most, I told a&nbsp;crowd of homicide detectives. “Sounds like it was blind luck,”&nbsp;one agent quipped.</span></p><div><img src="when-nerds-and-words-collide_files/when-nerds-and-words-collide-11.jpg" style="width:67pt;height:85pt;"/>
<p><span class="font2">Michael J. Berens is a project reporter for the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Chicago Tribune.</span><span class="font2"> He has been a frequent speaker&nbsp;and trainer for IRE. Computer assisted projects&nbsp;include a secretive state plan to warehouse&nbsp;young psychiatric patients in geriatric nursing&nbsp;homes: a possible serial killer trolling truck stops&nbsp;nationally; the deadly toll of police chases and&nbsp;federal government underreporting; and cops&nbsp;who owned crack houses.</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
<p><span class="font12">Indeed, luck is part of the quotient. For example, I computerized search warrants on a spreadsheet to analyze the success of the crack war. One of the fields - reluctantly included following&nbsp;an editor’s suggestion - designated the time and day of the raid. I</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">was looking for corruption, not a feature story. But the computer findings surprised us: No raids were ever conducted on a weekend. My partner and I ran out to some crack neighborhoods. One&nbsp;dealer smiled as he told us, “Sure, we know about that. That’s&nbsp;why we are open only on weekends.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">To this day, I adhere to three basic philosophies:</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Begin small.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Think simple.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No detail is unimportant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">It’s not necessary to learn how to write programming language. Learn what is necessary to accomplish the job. The computer&nbsp;should serve you. With each story comes more skill. Before you&nbsp;know it, you’ll find yourself knee-high in magnetic tapes and relational database programs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Some industry observers say that journalists have arrived at a</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">technological crossroad. The advent of the Internet has dramatically altered how we accumulate information, and given rise to reader expectations. We already have multimedia newsrooms as&nbsp;print reporters double as television hosts, and assist in web page&nbsp;design. The birth of virtual reality will further transform the&nbsp;journalistic landscape.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Sadly, newsrooms have been slow to react. And the majority of reporters remain modern-day illiterates - unable to read a&nbsp;world of computerized information. Newsroom training remains one of the most inexcusable deficiencies. For most, the&nbsp;crossroads are still many miles away.</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">15</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
<p><span class="font12">The secret is not to follow the machine. Instead, follow your passion for the story; use the computer to track your ideas and&nbsp;test those hunches. When that happens, you will have a lifetime&nbsp;source like no other.</span></p><h3><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font19">Using People, Not Numbers, to Tell the Story</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">By Sarah Cohen</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">In inviting speakers to an annual conference on computer assisted reporting last year, I began to hear a new complaint:&nbsp;“That wasn’t computer assisted reporting,” at least a couple of&nbsp;reporters said. “There weren’t any numbers in it.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">That objection - a false one, in my view - is a telling detail in the state of computer assisted reporting in the United States. And&nbsp;it’s one that shapes much of my view of where the specialty is&nbsp;and what we might do to further its development.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Maybe my concern over misconceptions that frame computer assisted reporting as reporting on numbers comes from my&nbsp;unusual background.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">As an economist for a decade before becoming a reporter, I felt that trade focused too much on figures and not enough on&nbsp;people and their problems. Economists, it seemed, had forgotten&nbsp;that the field is much more a human story than a quantitative&nbsp;one.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Soon before I made my career change, a colleague armed with a doctorate in the field solidified the decision.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">He was considering the purchase of a townhouse in a pricey Washington suburb. He complained that a house he preferred&nbsp;down the street was exactly the same, but the sellers were asking&nbsp;“more than the market price.” This economist went on to&nbsp;describe the reasons he preferred the too-expensive one. They&nbsp;ranged from the color of the carpets to the sunshine that poured&nbsp;into the kitchen on cold winter mornings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">I couldn’t get him to understand that the “market price” he sought was just a series of decisions by buyers like him on the&nbsp;value of the color of the caipets and a southern exposure in the&nbsp;kitchen. This, mind you, was someone who’d spent seven years&nbsp;in college studying microeconomics - the field that focuses on&nbsp;how prices are set.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">So came the decision to move to journalism, where reporters and their editors understood that human decisions describe what&nbsp;happens in the national and international economy better than&nbsp;numbers do. And, yes, I was lucky enough to later cover&nbsp;economics and frame the beat in my own words - making and&nbsp;spending money.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">But I was ill-prepared for the surprise I was about to encounter. It never dawned on me that journalists had managed&nbsp;to ignore the tools that had become a mainstay in virtually every&nbsp;other line of work, from economics to cash register design. The&nbsp;information revolution caused partly by the micro-computer and&nbsp;its applications had passed by the very craft that makes its living&nbsp;harnessing information.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Computer assisted reporting was clearly in my future.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">For the past two years, though, I’ve been traveling the country helping others learn to use spreadsheets, databases, and other&nbsp;“computer assisted” tools in the newsroom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">There’s probably been more progress during these two years than any other. And it has nothing to do with me.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">As the Internet makes its way onto reporters’ desktops, as personal computers find their way into newsrooms, and as</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">reporters watch how harnessing public records electronically can lead them to great stories, there are terrific examples of successful daily and project work around the country. A few worth&nbsp;noting:</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kathy Rizzo, a beat reporter for The Associated Press in&nbsp;Washington, regularly downloads the text of bills into her&nbsp;computer. She transfers lists into a spreadsheet to find examples&nbsp;of pork making their way to her areas.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">The Lima News</span><span class="font12"> in Ohio acquired a database of pet licenses&nbsp;shortly after my visit there in 1997. Reporters, who knew it was&nbsp;available in their newsroom, searched it for dog owners when&nbsp;Taco Bell began a popular ad campaign featuring Chihuahuas.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">* Dan Keating at </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">The Miami Herald</span><span class="font12"> was instrumental in a too-rare partnership among editors and beat reporters to document voter fraud. There were few numbers in the ensuing&nbsp;project. Instead, the newspaper documented cases of voter fraud&nbsp;that helped overturn an election and prompted legislative&nbsp;change.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">I highlight these stories because they’re the kinds of stories that </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">should</span><span class="font12"> be more common. Working together to find&nbsp;newsworthy cases, using resources already acquired, and&nbsp;harnessing your desktop for one-minute sorting jobs are the key&nbsp;to using public records electronically.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">I think these are rare for a number of reasons.</span></p><h4><a name="bookmark33"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The false choice</span></h4>
<p><span class="font12">Unfortunately, many managers and reporters alike have set up a false choice in the newsroom - one that’s illustrated by the&nbsp;speakers’ objection that a story isn’t worthy of a computer assisted reporting panel if it doesn’t include numbers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The choice is between statistics and people in stories, or between social scientists and master storytellers in the newsroom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Instead, the promise of computer assisted reporting has never changed. It remains one of the best ways available to check tips,&nbsp;generate news sources, and help ensure that the moving human&nbsp;stories we tell reflect a larger truth.</span></p><h4><a name="bookmark34"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The big-bang theory</span></h4>
<p><span class="font12">Reporters and their editors are, by nature, impatient. Otherwise a newscast would never hit the airwaves or a newspaper would never hit the sidewalk. But this impatience gets in the&nbsp;way of reporters learning new skills.</span></p><div><img src="when-nerds-and-words-collide_files/when-nerds-and-words-collide-12.jpg" style="width:67pt;height:85pt;"/>
<p><span class="font2">Sarah Cohen is database editor at </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Washington Post.</span><span class="font2"> She previously was training director for IRE, spending most of her time in newsrooms&nbsp;around the country helping reporters learn computer assisted reporting. She also has covered&nbsp;economics, workplace issues, and health care for&nbsp;Florida newspapers, including the St. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Petersburg&nbsp;Times.</span><span class="font2"> She spent a decade working as an economist in Washington before becoming a reporter.</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
<p><span class="font12">Few reporters cut then teeth on big projects. They learned, through practice, how to steer a telling interview, how to write a</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">lead, and how to find a detail in a police report. They learned these skills on routine stories, covering small city budgets,&nbsp;flower shows, and Saturday cops shifts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">In fact, many journalists struggle with writing, interviewing, documents reporting, and news judgment their entire careers.&nbsp;These skills, which form the backbone of what many of us call&nbsp;journalism, take a lifetime of work. Experience counts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">But we seem to think we can add a skill - the effective use of electronic records - in a few days. And if the training doesn’t&nbsp;result in a major project produced more quickly than with traditional tools of the trade, it’s been a waste.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">This seems to me to be the opposite of the way it ought to be viewed, and I think computer assisted reporting specialists can&nbsp;help make that transition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Instead, we ought to warn editors and reporters, reminding them how many times they had to call back a source to get a&nbsp;detail they’d forgotten - an age, an address, or a make of a car-before it became second nature to ask the first time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">We can do more to build computer assisted reporting into routine work, as well. When I go on the road, I recommend that&nbsp;many reporters - particularly the most talented ones, who are&nbsp;most anxious about the payoff - use a spreadsheet or database to&nbsp;help them with work they’re already doing. They might type&nbsp;notes of a long court case into the spreadsheet, and let it generate&nbsp;the chronology they need to help tell the story. Or at least acquire a database that contains more words than numbers, or&nbsp;more anecdotes than data.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">That way, they’ll have the skills, and understand the risks, when it comes time to work on the project.</span></p><h4><a name="bookmark35"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">CAR as online research</span></h4>
<p><span class="font12">Clearly, the explosion of material on the Internet, and the growth of other online tools, has helped spread the understanding of the power of databases in reporting. These are nothing but&nbsp;large, sometimes unstructured, databases.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">There’s also a downside to the Internet explosion. Many reporters continue to believe that every fact or anecdote they&nbsp;need is on the Internet, and there’s no need to learn other skills.&nbsp;And others are framing the Internet as the “news” tool, with&nbsp;spreadsheets, databases, and even mapping programs as the “extras.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Many participants in IRE workshops are shocked to find out that their local payroll isn’t on the Internet. Or that they can’t&nbsp;fully background a person for free using the World Wide Web.&nbsp;Or that the search engines on government websites often miss&nbsp;the most useful material. Or that searching databases on the Internet usually produces a report to print, not a data set to mine&nbsp;even deeper.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The confusion between online tools and other tools is leading a generation of reporters to think there is nothing left to learn.&nbsp;They’re wrong, and their reporting will reflect that mistaken&nbsp;view.</span></p><h4><a name="bookmark36"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Public records obstacles</span></h4>
<p><span class="font12">Of course, threats to paper public records are emerging everywhere, and privatization of government tasks is making this more difficult. Some states remain easier than others. And as a</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">handful of tests around the nation shows, public officials often ignore the open records laws already on the books.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">But obtaining electronic records adds a level of complexity, and a wait, that many reporters and their editors find unacceptable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">This is where CAR experts can help the most.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">But overcoming the public records threat requires they become fully integrated into newsroom rites they have so far&nbsp;avoided - story planning sessions, budget meetings, and even&nbsp;editor conferences. It also requires that editors and other newsroom managers understand that they may not get records&nbsp;tomorrow. But they may have them next time the story emerges.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">These four factors have not just hindered the integration of computer assisted reporting in the newsroom. Some managers&nbsp;believe that, in fact, it’s as integrated as it ought to be.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">But I believe these managers have set up another false choice</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;one that computer assisted reporting experts have more power&nbsp;to change than any other. That is, the choice between becoming&nbsp;immersed in data and immersed in journalism.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">First, though, the promise. Years ago, many observers claimed there would come a day when computer assisted reporting experts no longer existed. Instead of the expert in the comer, they&nbsp;argued, everyone would share in the skills and use them as needed for stories.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Very soon, in fact, reporters ought to have no excuse for an inability to download a report from the Internet and sort it to&nbsp;help find news. And very soon, reporters ought to be able to&nbsp;search a database of public records for the telling tip or the&nbsp;perfect interview subject. They ought to seek out databases that&nbsp;will help them with routine daily stories along with new&nbsp;projects. In fact, I would argue that in many newsrooms, there is&nbsp;no excuse </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">now.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">But knowing what other databases exist, hacking through the bureaucratic doublespeak that still surrounds most local and&nbsp;state public records databases, and getting them into useful&nbsp;shape is a task that most reporters will rarely need. These skills&nbsp;are also the most difficult. There’s no reason that everyone need&nbsp;go through that pain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">I do think computer assisted reporting experts must define then<sup>-</sup> own roles more carefully. I think there are two hats these&nbsp;experts can wear, sometimes in the same job.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The first is that of a reporter - either alone or as part of a team</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;who shepherds a story through the reporting process, harnessing every resource and conducting original research. This is&nbsp;documents reporting at perhaps its highest level, the precision&nbsp;journalism that Phil Meyer describes. It adheres to the strictest&nbsp;of journalistic standards. And it follows precepts in reporting&nbsp;outlined by such traditional editors as Bob Greene of </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Newsday&nbsp;</span><span class="font12">and John Ullman, author of </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">The Reporter’s Handbook.</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">17</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
<p><span class="font12">The second is one of an editor. In fact, I believe this role is closer to a writing coach or a projects editor who scans the&nbsp;newsroom for the stories with the greatest potential. Make no&nbsp;mistake, though: This is a management job, and reporters who&nbsp;choose this role on a story oughtn’t be concerned with bylines.&nbsp;Their editors aren’t. They ought to be concerned with helping&nbsp;reporters get the most out of their own stories, not writing stories&nbsp;or doing the research for them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Through self-preservation, though, some of these experts have leaned toward managing and maintaining databases for the&nbsp;newsroom, only to find that their job resembles a systems or&nbsp;library role rather than a reporting or editing role. I believe they&nbsp;need to back off that task, or shift their jobs into those departments. That’s because they’re setting up a support operation in&nbsp;the newsroom - one that’s needed and rewarding, but one that’s&nbsp;not reporting or editing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">I realize their management may expect them to do these functions. I realize many experts become byte-heads out of self-preservation. And I realize they want to stay on the cutting edge.&nbsp;But running an intranet is not what anyone went into reporting to&nbsp;do. Putting databases on the web is a production job, not a&nbsp;journalistic job.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">If it’s what these experts </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">do</span><span class="font12"> want to do, then they ought to realize that they’re no longer journalists in the sense that many</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">people define the word. Pretending it is reporting or editing risks diluting the journalistic functions they do perform.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Part of the solution comes from more informed management. And there’s evidence that a new generation of managers - not all&nbsp;of them young - will help smooth this transition. From Pat Stith&nbsp;in Raleigh, N.C., to Shawn McIntosh in Jackson, Miss., former&nbsp;computer assisted reporting experts are infiltrating the ranks of&nbsp;line management. That’s a partial solution.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The rest of the solution comes from within our own community - to better define what we do to more traditional&nbsp;managers, to educate our own editors.</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">18</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
<p><span class="font12">We should let go of functions that belong elsewhere in the newsroom, or move with them. And we should free the reporters&nbsp;in our newsrooms or ourselves to get back to the jobs we love&nbsp;the most - telling stories, understanding documents in any form,&nbsp;and following the story.</span></p><h3><a name="bookmark37"></a><span class="font19">It’s Time to Drive CAR Concepts Home</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">By Stephen K. Doig</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">I like to think of myself as living proof that if you’re bright enough to be a good reporter, you’re bright enough to leam to do&nbsp;computer assisted reporting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Looking back, I now realize I was interested in computer assisted reporting even before I knew I was going to be a&nbsp;reporter. My freshman calculus professor at Dartmouth College&nbsp;in 1966 was John Kemeny, the co-inventor of the BASIC computer language. Kemeny’s novel idea was that computers, which&nbsp;still were Big Iron in those distant days, could and should be&nbsp;used even by us non-techie liberal arts types. I remember almost&nbsp;nothing of calculus today, but the experience of fooling around&nbsp;with BASIC programs stuck with me as I wandered from one&nbsp;major to the next during my on-again, off-again college career.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Arguably, my first CAR effort was in 1974 for a senior-year government paper analyzing the emerging Republican presence&nbsp;in Florida, using the statistics functions built into Dartmouth’s&nbsp;computer system. By that time, during a three-year hiatus from&nbsp;college at the dean’s insistence, the U.S. Army had taught me the&nbsp;rudiments of being a reporter. But it was eight years later before&nbsp;I started doing CAR as a real journalist.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">In 1982, I was in </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">The Miami Herald’s</span><span class="font12"> Tallahassee bureau covering state government. At home, I had been reading a lot&nbsp;about hobby computers like the Altair and Apple. Finally, to my&nbsp;wife’s horror, I spent a couple thousand dollars to buy an Atari&nbsp;800 system (loaded with 16K of RAM!), and enjoyed relearning BASIC by writing little programs to teach my kids&nbsp;addition and how to tell time. However, the more I played with&nbsp;the Atari at home, the more I kept realizing how a computer&nbsp;might help me do things as work, such as calculating state budget changes or tracking campaign contribution reports.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">A few months later, the bureau added a reporter and we needed another writing terminal. I persuaded the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Herald</span><span class="font12"> instead to buy one of the new IBM PCs (64K RAM, a 360K floppy, green&nbsp;monochrome screen and a screamin’ 4MHz!). Along with the&nbsp;word processor XyWrite, I bought the PC flavor of VisiCalc, the&nbsp;first spreadsheet, and started using it for budget analyses and&nbsp;other stories. My first real CAR application, though, was a&nbsp;BASIC program I wrote to analyze legislative roll-call votes on&nbsp;deadline. It would take the yeas and nays and churn out&nbsp;crosstabs on the split not just by party, but also by region,&nbsp;gender, race, special interest contributions, leadership vs. rank-and-file, et al. I even made it write out the “How they Voted”&nbsp;agate. (Of course, today such an application can be built in&nbsp;minutes with an off-the-shelf database.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">About the same time, I discovered Phil Meyer and </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Precision Journalism.</span><span class="font12"> During his years with Knight Ridder, Meyer was&nbsp;the first in a string of reporters at the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Herald</span><span class="font12"> to use such social&nbsp;science methods as polling and statistical analysis on reporting&nbsp;problems. In about 1983, the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Herald</span><span class="font12"> training depaxtment had&nbsp;brought Meyer, by then a professor at the University of North&nbsp;Carolina, to talk up his precision vision to a handful of math-adept </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Herald</span><span class="font12"> reporters such as Richard Morin (now director of</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">polling for </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">The Washington Post</span><span class="font12">) and myself. I got a copy of the book, and decided I wanted to be Phil Meyer when I grew up.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">I transferred back to the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Herald’s</span><span class="font12"> main office in 1984, covering courts and then science. But I also missed my Tallahassee IBM, so I spent another couple grand on a PC-XT (with a&nbsp;spacious 10 megabyte hard drive and speedy 1200 baud&nbsp;modem!). In Miami, the same pattern occurred: The more cool&nbsp;things I learned to do on my hobby computer at home, the more I&nbsp;kept seeing ways it could be used at work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">And not just for my own work. It seemed like every day I’d be walking past the desk of some reporter or other, and see him or&nbsp;her doing something like adding up a long column of numbers&nbsp;using a cheap calculator or digging through a thick stack of&nbsp;project notes looking for a particular quote. More and more, I&nbsp;found myself stopping to say, “Hey, I’ve got a way to help you&nbsp;with that.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Before long, I was spending one or two days a week at home, working on other reporters’ projects with my personal computer.&nbsp;(I’m grateful that my editors let me get away with this apparent&nbsp;dereliction of my own work.) After a while, desktop computers&nbsp;started showing up in the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Herald</span><span class="font12"> newsroom - though only on&nbsp;the desks of executive secretaries. So I started sneaking onto one&nbsp;of those computers when the desk’s occupant was out to lunch&nbsp;or had gone home. My contributions to others’ stories, and some&nbsp;projects of my own, finally became visible enough that when the&nbsp;secretaries’ machines were upgraded, I was given one of the&nbsp;hand-me-downs. My career as CAR specialist was semiofficial!</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">My leap into high-end CAR came in 1990 when the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Herald </span><span class="font12">started a project on money-laundering in South Florida. The&nbsp;project reporters came to me and said they could get all sorts of&nbsp;data on 9-track magnetic tape, but they didn’t know how to work&nbsp;with the stuff. Neither did I, but I nodded sagely and said I’d figure something out. As it happened, the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Herald’s</span><span class="font12"> business side&nbsp;had just hired a new vice president to oversee the company’s&nbsp;data processing department. I met her as she was touring the&nbsp;building and mentioned our project. Without missing a beat, she&nbsp;said she’d check into it.</span></p><div><img src="when-nerds-and-words-collide_files/when-nerds-and-words-collide-13.jpg" style="width:67pt;height:85pt;"/>
<p><span class="font2">Stephen K. Doig is Knight Chair in Journalism, specializing in computer assisted reporting, at&nbsp;Arizona State University. Before Joining ASU in&nbsp;1996, he was research editor of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Miami&nbsp;Herald,</span><span class="font2"> where he worked for 19 years. Computer&nbsp;assisted projects on which he worked at the&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Herald</span><span class="font2"> have won the Pulitzer Prize, the IRE Grand&nbsp;Prize, the Goldsmith Prize for Investigative&nbsp;Reporting, and other awards.</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
<p><span class="font12">Next thing I knew, I was given free and complete access to the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Herald’s</span><span class="font12"> IBM mainframe and enough instruction from the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">real&nbsp;</span><span class="font12">programmers there to soon be writing my own SAS programs&nbsp;and job control language. I realize that some CAR veterans,&nbsp;such as Elliot Jaspin, insist that the newsroom should develop its&nbsp;own capability to work with tape data. My experience at the</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Herald</span><span class="font12"> makes me argue that, at the least, we should make overtures to our data processing folks. Instead of having to squeeze the newsroom budget to buy some cranky desktop tape drive,&nbsp;chances are all the equipment you need is sitting somewhere&nbsp;else in your building. (A further tip: A bit of humility goes a long&nbsp;way. The DP folks kept remarking that I was great to work with&nbsp;because I wasn’t an arrogant prima donna like most reporters. It&nbsp;made me appreciate how little-liked we reporters are - even&nbsp;within our own walls.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">My bosses gave me lots of freedom (and even a little funding) to learn almost anything I thought would be a good CAR tool.&nbsp;My position soon evolved into a full-time CAR consultancy,&nbsp;allowing me to work with reporters and editors from any desk,&nbsp;and even occasionally on non-newsroom projects. I deliberately&nbsp;sought that role, because I liked the challenge of solving the&nbsp;wide range of reporting problems that were brought to me.&nbsp;Some CAR specialists worry about being treated as “the nerd in&nbsp;the corner,” not seen as real journalists. I sympathize with that&nbsp;concern for young CAR specialists, but it wasn’t a problem for&nbsp;me, thanks to my longevity at the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Herald</span><span class="font12"> and my success with&nbsp;some high-visibility projects.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">This raises one of the big continuing issues with CAR: Should all reporters and editors leant these skills? I favor the tier model:</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All reporters and editors should know what CAR can do, so&nbsp;they don’t waste time or lose story opportunities. They should at&nbsp;least be able to know when to go find a CAR specialist for help.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All reporters and editors should learn at least the rudiments&nbsp;of online research, such as using search engines.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reporters and editors who have enough math skills to&nbsp;reliably calculate percentage change should learn to use a&nbsp;spreadsheet. (Some journalists are too math-challenged to be&nbsp;allowed near software that will let them make thousands of&nbsp;mistakes in a split second.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The few who start to hit the limits of what spreadsheets can&nbsp;do should be encouraged to learn a good database program.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, someone in the newsroom should know the high-end tricks: statistical analysis, mapping, tape cracking, polling,&nbsp;applications programming, intranet development, et al.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">In other words, a newsroom full of people like me would be a disaster. But every newsroom should have at least one!</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Note that I keep mentioning editors. I feel the most worrisome CAR issue right now is the lack of editors who understand CAR.&nbsp;During much of my career at the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Herald,</span><span class="font12"> my editors basically&nbsp;had to trust me that I did my data analyses right. Not until Rich&nbsp;Gordon joined the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Herald</span><span class="font12"> did I have someone else I could</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">bounce my methodology off to see if it made sense. With most journalism skills, you can generally count on your editors to&nbsp;have considerable experience and insight that will help make&nbsp;your story better and guide you away from pitfalls. But CAR has&nbsp;been very much a bottom-up movement, which means that there&nbsp;are too few editors who know enough to spot messy data, bad&nbsp;formulas, or shaky assumptions. That may change as more CAR&nbsp;veterans start moving into the supervisory ranks. But the very&nbsp;success of the CAR training programs at creating hundreds of&nbsp;eager computer assisted reporters means that editor/reporter&nbsp;ratio still is dangerously small. We haven’t had a CAR disaster&nbsp;of Janet Cooke proportions - but we will if our bosses keep&nbsp;letting us do ever-more complicated projects without competent&nbsp;backstopping from good editors.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">I needn’t go on at length about the progress that CAR has made in journalism. When we graybeards started doing this, we&nbsp;were scattered in a few newsrooms around the country, not even&nbsp;knowing that there were a few others trying the same thing.&nbsp;Today, hundreds of papers routinely publish stories that simply&nbsp;would have been impossible without CAR. We’ve given our&nbsp;readers and viewers access to information they couldn’t have&nbsp;gotten so easily before, whether it is neighborhood crime&nbsp;statistics, local property value changes, or school test score&nbsp;comparisons. I think it is extraordinary that such radically new&nbsp;techniques have been adopted so quickly and broadly in a&nbsp;profession as basically conservative as journalism.</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font0">20</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
<p><span class="font12">But much progress remains to be made. Basic CAR ability -the use of spreadsheets and online research - needs to be seen as much a job qualification for a reporter as the ability to type and&nbsp;spell. Unfortunately, I think that the next 10 years will see much&nbsp;slower growth of CAR into newsrooms and classrooms than&nbsp;occurred during the past decade. We CAR evangelists have&nbsp;already skimmed the cream by capturing the interest and enthusiasm of the hundreds of reporters (and a few professors) who&nbsp;have a natural aptitude for this kind of work. By now, though,&nbsp;thousands of other reporters and editors (and professors) have&nbsp;seen what CAR can do. If they haven’t already said, “Wow, I&nbsp;gotta leam to do some of that!” then chances are they won’t. The&nbsp;answer, I think, is found in journalism schools. They must find&nbsp;ways to spread CAR concepts into every skills class across the&nbsp;curriculum, rather than being satisfied with offering a high-level&nbsp;computer course that only a tiny fraction of students will take.&nbsp;Only when the majority of J-grads are CAR-aware and start&nbsp;filling newsrooms from the bottom up will CAR skills go from&nbsp;being a bonus to being a requirement.</span></p><h3><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font19">Reflections of a One-Eyed Man</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">By Rich Gordon</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">There was a time - it really wasn’t too many years ago - when I began to have a vision of the future. Reporters could just sit&nbsp;down at their computers, pull up a trove of useful information,&nbsp;and use it, not just to produce big investigative projects, but to&nbsp;make every story better than it would have been otherwise. As it&nbsp;turns out, the future is now. The bottomless hole of information&nbsp;is the World Wide Web. And the web isn’t just a research tool;&nbsp;it’s an unparalleled way of delivering deep, rich data to our&nbsp;readers. So why isn’t our journalism better? And why haven’t&nbsp;we done a better job of getting actionable information into the&nbsp;hands of the public?</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">I don’t mean to denigrate the fine, fine journalism produced every day in newspapers (and TV stations and even some websites). And I don’t doubt the impact that computer assisted&nbsp;reporting has had on newsrooms large and small. Though I’ve&nbsp;been out of the world of reporting for more than three years now,&nbsp;I still subscribe to the NICAR listserv. I am frequently struck by&nbsp;the sophistication of the dialogue, by the wide range of news organizations doing solid computer assisted reporting work, and by&nbsp;the huge distance that CAR has come since I took my first steps a&nbsp;dozen years ago. There was a time - again, not too many years&nbsp;back - when I felt I knew more about CAR than all but a handful&nbsp;of journalists in America. Now I feel far, far behind the curve.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">I also feel partly responsible that the two papers where I earned my CAR stripes - the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Palm Beach Post</span><span class="font12"> and </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">The Miami&nbsp;Herald -</span><span class="font12"> have not become the well-oiled analytical machines&nbsp;that I once envisioned. In the end, I and my fellow advocates for&nbsp;computer assisted reporting still haven’t fundamentally changed&nbsp;the way most of our newsrooms approach the process of gathering and making sense out of information.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Yes, many papers now have a data “guru” who helps produce big projects and also frequently (more frequently than management realizes) helps other reporters do a better job on their&nbsp;stories. And yes, some newspapers have a library/research staff&nbsp;that provides the range of services needed by a newsroom staff:&nbsp;from training to acquiring and maintaining databases to conducting research on a reporter’s behalf. But you could still fire a&nbsp;spreadsheet through a crowded newsroom and not hit anyone&nbsp;who knew what to do with it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">My personal experience with computers goes back to my college days at the University of Pennsylvania. I was a history&nbsp;major who spent most of my days (and nights) at the offices of&nbsp;the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Daily Pennsylvanian,</span><span class="font12"> but I did manage to attend most of my&nbsp;classes. And I had a broader range of interests than most of my&nbsp;liberal arts colleagues, perhaps because I’d always had an&nbsp;aptitude for, and interest in, numbers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">So I took an introductory programming course at Penn, based on a now-obscure language called APL (which supposedly&nbsp;stood for “A Programming Language” - those computer programmers have such a sense of humor!).</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">I did well in the class, and enjoyed it immensely. So I decided to try a second-level programming course in the engineering</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">school and came closer to failing that course than any other I took at Penn.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Eight years or so later, I found myself at the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Richmond Times-Dispatch,</span><span class="font12"> embarking on a project looking at the impact of population growth on the state of Virginia. One of the first things&nbsp;I did was pull population statistics for every county and city in&nbsp;Virginia going back to the turn of the century. To put Virginia in&nbsp;perspective, I also found population figures for every U.S. state&nbsp;for the same time period. Of course, I wanted to figure out where&nbsp;the greatest growth had occurred. I knew there had to be an easier way than a calculator and a legal pad, so I asked one of the&nbsp;newsroom systems editors if he had any ideas. “Lotus 1-2-3,” he&nbsp;said. And I was off to the races. He already had it on his PC (he&nbsp;was one of the few in the newsroom who even had a PC at his&nbsp;desk), and he didn’t come in until 3 p.m., so I could bang away&nbsp;at his desk all morning and most of the afternoon. Of course, I&nbsp;had to type in all the numbers myself, but it was worth it when I&nbsp;saw how easy it was to analyze the population trends.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">When I arrived a couple of years later at the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Palm Beach Post, </span><span class="font12">I found other opportunities to apply my number-crunching&nbsp;interests, not to mention my typing skills. We looked at county&nbsp;commissioners’ cellular phone bills, bridge inspection data,&nbsp;nuclear plant performance records, campaign contributions. In&nbsp;each case, we typed the numbers into the computer by hand and&nbsp;went to work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The next pivotal moment was “The Color of Money,” the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Atlanta Journal-Constitution’s</span><span class="font12"> examination of bank home mortgage lending patterns. The </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Post,</span><span class="font12"> like the Atlanta paper, was (and&nbsp;is) owned by Cox Communications. Cox sent Dwight&nbsp;Morris, who did the number-crunching for the mortgage project,&nbsp;to the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Post</span><span class="font12"> to give a seminar on CAR and give us a jump-start.&nbsp;To be honest, his advice wasn’t much help - Dwight did all his&nbsp;work on a mainframe using SPSS - but his attitude and rigorous&nbsp;approach were inspiring. (See Morris’s essay on page 35.)</span></p><div><img src="when-nerds-and-words-collide_files/when-nerds-and-words-collide-14.jpg" style="width:62pt;height:85pt;"/></div><br clear="all"/><div>

<p><span class="font12">Somehow, I learned about the Missouri Institute for Computer Assisted Reporting, and was able to get a space in Elliot Jaspin’s&nbsp;first class. I came back singing the praises of 9-track tape drives&nbsp;and XDB database software. Fortunately for me, my colleagues&nbsp;at the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Post</span><span class="font12"> talked me out of both of those. We were able to get 9-tracks run by the paper’s Information Systems department, and&nbsp;one of the newsroom systems guys talked me into using Paradox&nbsp;(which he’d already purchased) rather than XDB. And somewhat&nbsp;miraculously, I was able to persuade my bosses to give me an intern to help on CAR projects.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">For my first big project, I zeroed in on property assessments for a number of reasons. First, I figured that I would find something screwed up in the assessment system. In an area growing&nbsp;as rapidly as the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Post’s</span><span class="font12"> territory was, there just had to be inequities. Second, even if all I did was explain the system to people, I figured there would be interest in the story - everyone is&nbsp;interested in their taxes. We were able to prove conclusively that&nbsp;property assessments were inequitable for people owning less&nbsp;expensive homes. It was not really a surprising finding - other&nbsp;newspapers had found the same thing in their communities - but&nbsp;the story got a lot of attention.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">I didn’t realize how good I had it at the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Post</span><span class="font12"> until I succumbed to a recruitment pitch from </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">The Miami Herald’s</span><span class="font12"> Broward County edition. I went to a big-league paper in an ultra-competitive&nbsp;market, but I lost my intern, my supportive management, and&nbsp;my high-powered PC. The best computer in the office was an&nbsp;IBM 286 that was at least five years old. I became a big fan of&nbsp;Reflex, a DOS database manager that did truly remarkable&nbsp;things with little disk space or memory. With nothing more than&nbsp;that 286, Reflex, and Quattro Pro, we were able to do some good&nbsp;small-scale projects. And I also struck up a terrific relationship&nbsp;with Steve Doig, the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Herald’s</span><span class="font12"> CAR guru. We looked at drunken&nbsp;driving convictions, population trends (the 1990 census came&nbsp;out while I was in Broward), campaign contributions, and more.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">In the early days of the popularization of CAR, there was something of a schism between the spreadsheet disciples and the&nbsp;database mavens. The dividing line roughly paralleled the&nbsp;division between day-to-day CAR and project-related CAR. My&nbsp;experience, coming to databases only after mastering spreadsheets, convinced me that spreadsheets were the most useful&nbsp;tool for the typical reporter, and that the greatest benefits of&nbsp;CAR didn’t show up in mega-projects but in basic beat reporting. After one or two of the NICAR conferences, I think most of&nbsp;us who were teaching CAR concluded that there was a happy&nbsp;marriage between the two. Spreadsheets were a terrific entry&nbsp;point, but databases offered the greatest potential impact.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">At the same time, I think we have all been guilty of focusing on tools rather than on techniques. In order to convince others&nbsp;(and ourselves) that what we were doing had merit, we emphasized hardware and software rather than the analytical skills few&nbsp;journalists have mastered. When we named our field, we came&nbsp;up with a term (computer assisted reporting) that put the&nbsp;machine up front. I think we’d be better off using the much older&nbsp;term, popularized if not coined by Phil Meyer, of “precision&nbsp;journalism.” Because precision is what CAR is all about -moving away from “he said/she said” reporting and reaching the&nbsp;real, incontrovertible truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">From a distance, I see and read about newsrooms that seem to have made much progress toward the world of precision journalism, such as </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">The News &amp; Observer</span><span class="font12"> in Raleigh, N.C., which&nbsp;has given its news researchers a lead role in information gathering and maintenance. Or </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">The Philadelphia Inquirer,</span><span class="font12"> where Neill&nbsp;Borowski and Tom Torok have helped dozens of reporters&nbsp;produce outstanding work, and then published their databases to&nbsp;web servers for reporters and the general public to use. But these&nbsp;are the exceptions, I’m afraid, and even these CAR leaders</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">would tell you there are still many, many reporters at their papers - and an even greater share of newsroom leaders - who just don’t understand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Unfortunately, I think the cachet of CAR may have largely disappeared by now. We’re not going to change journalism by&nbsp;teaching every reporter to use Excel or Access. We need to get&nbsp;reporters to think differently, to approach information more&nbsp;analytically, to believe that you can find a kind of truth with&nbsp;numbers that you will never find in anecdotes or interviews. It&nbsp;will require a broad-based campaign, targeted at all levels of the&nbsp;newsroom. But for many of our colleagues, it is already too late.&nbsp;They got into this business because they liked to write, not&nbsp;crunch numbers. They liked talking to people, not seeking&nbsp;answers from a database. We’re going to need to focus even&nbsp;more attention on the new people coming into our business -high school and college students considering journalism as a&nbsp;career, but also being tempted by the higher salaries and greater&nbsp;sex appeal of other kinds of work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">I got my opportunity in online publishing because everyone at the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Herald</span><span class="font12"> - including me - thought the web represented the&nbsp;intersection of journalism and technology. My CAR experience&nbsp;had given me a reputation, among journalists, as a technology&nbsp;expert. It was my former colleague, Steve Doig, who told me&nbsp;that amounted to the old adage of being “a one-eyed man in the&nbsp;kingdom of the blind.” The experience of managing our web&nbsp;operation truly opened my eyes to how little I knew about technology. I also discovered that successfully running an online&nbsp;publication has less to do with editorial content or technology&nbsp;than with managing people and understanding the world of&nbsp;advertising and marketing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">I regret to say that the websites I oversee (<a href="http://www.herald.com">www.herald.com</a> and <a href="http://www.elherald.com">www.elherald.com</a>) are largely static, text-based sites. They&nbsp;contain some wonderful content from our print newspapers, but&nbsp;we haven’t done much to deliver data. At one time, I&nbsp;argued that CAR disciples would make the best online&nbsp;publishers, because we had a “database state of mind.” What I&nbsp;found was that the state of mind wasn’t enough; we also needed&nbsp;a combination of hardware, software, resources, journalistic&nbsp;talent, and technology smarts that we have brought together&nbsp;only rarely up until now.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The web is going to keep changing our industry - whether that means newsgathering in general, or newspapers more&nbsp;specifically. Our print “mother ships” are almost certainly going&nbsp;to become less profitable over time, as classified advertising&nbsp;moves from print to online. Occasionally I am asked what the&nbsp;future holds for newspaper reporters. What I tell them is that&nbsp;newspapers are most certainly going to change and may even&nbsp;disappear one day. But good reporters are going to be in ever&nbsp;greater demand. And I don’t mean the kind of reporters who&nbsp;publicize leaked information from special prosecutors or appear&nbsp;on Sunday morning talk shows. I mean journalists who can find&nbsp;truth where others rely on anecdote. Those who aren’t&nbsp;intimidated by numbers, but instead seek out data to confirm or&nbsp;reject the conventional wisdom. Those who have a “database&nbsp;state of mind.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">In short, precision journalists.</span></p><h3><a name="bookmark11"></a><span class="font19">The Education of a Computer Assisted Reporter</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">By Jim Heaney</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">I was greatly influenced early in my career by Phil Meyer’s book </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Precision Journalism</span><span class="font12"> and its proposition that reporters&nbsp;needed to go beyond traditional reporting methods. Many&nbsp;reporters have been able to act on that vision through the rise of&nbsp;computer assisted reporting, although I don’t feel newspapers&nbsp;have done a particularly good job of seizing the opportunity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">I got my first taste of CAR in 1986 when I covered transportation for </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">The Orlando Sentinel.</span><span class="font12"> An upcoming referendum was seeking voter approval to establish a regional transportation&nbsp;agency, with taxing power, to build roads. Everyone knew traffic was bad and getting worse, but I wanted to document the&nbsp;problem and determine to what extent the road improvements&nbsp;proposed by the agency would alleviate congestion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">I obtained data that showed the capacity and usage of all the roads that the new agency would have improved. Back then, few&nbsp;newsrooms had personal computers, and the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Sentinel</span><span class="font12"> was no&nbsp;exception. I wound up using a PC in the market research department and got the staff to show me how to use the software. After&nbsp;days of inputting, I finally had useful data, which translated into&nbsp;good stories and graphics that otherwise wouldn’t have been&nbsp;possible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Demonstrating how badly congested the road system was didn’t do agency advocates any good - the proposal was&nbsp;trounced in referendum - but the exercise gave me a sense of the&nbsp;possibilities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">I moved to </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">The Buffalo News</span><span class="font12"> later that year and found much the same situation. The market research department, not the&nbsp;newsroom, had the PCs, so I made friends there, doing a variety&nbsp;of stories. I have always liked “compare and contrast” stories,&nbsp;and CAR allowed me to do them with a lot of material at my&nbsp;disposal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">In the early 1990s I realized CAR was the wave of the future and set out to do a project that would force me to learn software&nbsp;and all the assorted ins and outs. It was time to cut the cord with&nbsp;the market research people, who had done their share of hand&nbsp;holding.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">I sold my editors on doing a series on slum housing in the city, which required building a database of all the code violators who&nbsp;had been prosecuted in city housing court. There was one&nbsp;problem, however. The courts had just started entering their&nbsp;housing records into a database the year before, and there wasn’t&nbsp;a sufficient record built yet. I shelved my series for a year and a&nbsp;half until there were three years of data.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">With that, my education began. I had to learn software. I learned of the perils of dirty data. I had people wondering what&nbsp;the hell Heaney was doing for all that time, playing with a&nbsp;computer but not producing stories. They soon found out.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">I produced a five-day series that identified the 12 worst slumlords in the city, pinpointed the streets with the worst housing, and detailed the total impotence of the housing court. The power&nbsp;of the series rested in the detail I was able to produce through my&nbsp;computer analysis. I was able to deliver the goods.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The series sold my editors on the promise of CAR, and other reporters at the paper starting following suit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">In the mid-1990s I tackled Buffalo’s public school system, taking over the beat and producing an eight-day series assessing&nbsp;the condition of the system. As a part of my reporting, I collaborated with a team of local university professors to build and&nbsp;analyze student demographic and testing data.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">I struggled with the same kinds of issues I did with the slumlord project - having to learn yet another software package, cleaning up dirty data, and, most of all, hying not to be overwhelmed by all the information. I went home with my brain&nbsp;fried more times than I care to remember.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">While I remain the beat reporter, I spend most of my time doing enterprise reporting, and I’ve found over the past couple&nbsp;of years that there are very few major stories for which I’m not&nbsp;tapping into a database or building a spreadsheet. CAR has&nbsp;made me more of a data-driven reporter than I used to be.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">At the same time, I spend a lot of time doing traditional street reporting, dealing with sources, and spending time in the&nbsp;schools. CAR is no substitute for being there, and more than&nbsp;once I have found that the conclusions drawn from my tidy&nbsp;spreadsheets don’t pass the reality test.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">I’ll admit that I’ve blown hot and cold on CAR. Old habits, office politics, pressure to generate stories off my beat, and plain&nbsp;old burnout have proven to be disincentives at times. Having to&nbsp;learn new software (I think I’m on my fourth version) tends to&nbsp;get old, especially when you’re often left to learn it on your own.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Yet I’ve come through the past 12 years convinced that any reporter worth a damn must master CAR techniques. When I&nbsp;speak to college journalism students, that’s usually one of the&nbsp;first points I make: Don’t graduate without learning a lot about&nbsp;using computers. My advice to uninitiated reporters is to find a&nbsp;story that will force them to learn the ropes. It’s easier to wade in&nbsp;through individual stories than to jump headfirst into a major&nbsp;project. I also encourage reporters to attend an Investigative&nbsp;Reporters and Editors (IRE) conference to soak up ideas.</span></p><div><img src="when-nerds-and-words-collide_files/when-nerds-and-words-collide-15.jpg" style="width:67pt;height:85pt;"/>
<p><span class="font2">Jim Heaney is data driven enterprise editor for </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Buffalo News.</span><span class="font2"> As an investigative reporter,&nbsp;he focused on urban issues including housing, city&nbsp;government, and education. He worked as a reporter and editor at </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Orlando Sentinel</span><span class="font2"> from&nbsp;1980-86. Heaney has won numerous journalism&nbsp;awards and was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize for&nbsp;investigative reporting in 1993.</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">23</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
<p><span class="font12">I think newspapers have come a fair way in embracing CAR, but not nearly far enough. CAR remains too much of a bottom-up phenomenon, practiced by reporters with initiative and&nbsp;ignored by those without. Newsroom management usually says&nbsp;the right things, but few people in charge have actually done&nbsp;CAR journalism, and their support is too much in the abstract&nbsp;and short of absolute. And it shows in the haphazard way that&nbsp;CAR has been introduced at many newspapers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">I believe CAR should be introduced in newsrooms in a very methodical, systematic way. Beats should be retrofit to incorporate CAR resources and techniques. Staff should receive all the&nbsp;necessary equipment and training. Staffing needs to be reconfigured. Editors have to gain a genuine appreciation of the potential&nbsp;of CAR and then hold reporters accountable for changing the&nbsp;way they do their jobs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">I see some papers doing a decent job of this in some ways, but I don’t get the sense that anyone is doing CAR the way it ought&nbsp;to be done.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">There’s a lot of CAR reporting done on projects and other non-deadline work, but I don’t see it woven into daily coverage&nbsp;to the extent it should. I think we’ve come up particularly short&nbsp;when it comes to using CAR to help put stories in context, particularly when it comes to crime. And be it daily or enterprise, I&nbsp;don’t think we’ve been especially inventive when it comes to&nbsp;story ideas.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">In short, we’re light years behind a lot of industries when it comes to applying technology, and while we’re making up&nbsp;ground, the pace isn’t quick enough.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">I think a couple of groups, The Poynter Institute and especially IRE, have done much to spread the word. I envision a larger role for them in the future, if they are so inclined.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Too many reporters, too many papers, are trying to figure this out on their own. We need a collaborative effort to accelerate the&nbsp;mainstreaming of CAR. I’d like to see a core of experienced&nbsp;CAR practitioners, working under the flag of IRE, Poynter, or&nbsp;whomever, to work together to advance the cause in different&nbsp;ways than what’s been attempted to this point.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">I’d start by identifying the major beats that all newspapers cover and retrofitting them using CAR resources and techniques. I would develop a model that any newspaper, any reporter, could&nbsp;plug in to. What are the best online resources available? What</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">sort of data are available from agencies and trade groups? Which listservs are worth joining? What are the obvious story ideas that&nbsp;can be pursued to get started? What sort of routines should a reporter get into? What sort of software should they know?</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">With this framework developed, individual reporters could customize their approach to the particulars of their situation. A&nbsp;transportation reporter in a city with a hub airport, for example,&nbsp;might want to focus more on aviation resources than someone&nbsp;dealing primaril) with congested roadways.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">I would take this a step further by having a central clearinghouse that would collect and analyze data that would be shared via an intranet with participating beat reporters to localize. An&nbsp;analysis of aviation safety records at large airports, for example,&nbsp;could generate dozens of local stories. But someone needs to be&nbsp;driving the process. This effort could start out small, with a core&nbsp;of newspapers piloting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">By doing this, CAR proponents could do more than just evangelize and convert one reporter at a time. They could expedite a more sweeping embrace of CAR in newsrooms, and they could&nbsp;influence what gets covered and how. Many of us grumble about&nbsp;the unhealthy influence of coiporate ownership. I see this as a&nbsp;way of constructively steering the ship closer to its appropriate&nbsp;course.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">I think we collectively have enough experience to do some of the things I’ve suggested. Newsroom management has bought&nbsp;into the CAR concept, so that part of the challenge is behind us.</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">24</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
<p><span class="font12">The challenge we face as we move forward is incorporating CAR in a more systematic and intelligent way. As an industiy,&nbsp;we’re not as good as we could, or should, be and I think CAR is&nbsp;our best realistic hope for improvement. Those in the front lines&nbsp;need to devise ways of imbedding the practice throughout our&nbsp;newsrooms. We need to broaden our strategy for accomplishing&nbsp;that.</span></p><h3><a name="bookmark38"></a><span class="font19">Evangelizing for CAR</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">By Jennifer LaFleur</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">In 1989,1 published a report analyzing the use of computers in newsrooms for completion of my master’s degree at the University of Missouri School of Journalism. At that time, most&nbsp;newsrooms used mainframe computers, and the Internet was a&nbsp;network of computers used only by government and academics.&nbsp;Some electronic information resources were available, such as&nbsp;government and association bulletin boards. For part of my&nbsp;1989 report, I conducted a survey of Washington correspondents&nbsp;about their use of electronic information systems. Most of them&nbsp;did not regularly use electronic information sources to do their&nbsp;jobs. Many didn’t even know what a modem was.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">I hunted down a few pioneers who had used computers to do stories. Elliot Jaspin used computer databases to analyze low-interest mortgages issued by the Rhode Island Housing and&nbsp;Mortgage Finance Corporation for the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Providence Journal-Bulletin.</span><span class="font12"> In 1983 </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Detroit Free Press</span><span class="font12"> reporter David Ashenfelter&nbsp;used computer information to generate a series of articles about&nbsp;inconsistencies in Michigan’s judicial system.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">I figured within the next decade, everyone would be using these tools. In 1989, Pulitzers were awarded to Rich Mauer of&nbsp;the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Anchorage Daily News</span><span class="font12"> for his analysis of the deaths of&nbsp;Alaskan natives and to Bill Dedman of the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Atlanta Journal-Constitution</span><span class="font12"> for his investigation of racial discrimination practiced by lending institutions in Atlanta. What’s probably the first&nbsp;CAR story was done in 1952 when Walter Cronkite did a story&nbsp;based on an analysis of election results on the first mainframe&nbsp;computer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Almost 10 years after that 1989 report, </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">San Jose Mercury News </span><span class="font12">reporter Linda Goldston, who had only ever used her computer to&nbsp;type stories, published a groundbreaking computer assisted reporting story for which she was able to do much of the analysis.&nbsp;And she is not alone. Although computer assisted repotting has&nbsp;not become the new telephone of the journalistic world, more&nbsp;reporters find it an invaluable addition to their tool box.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">On days when I become frustrated that no one cares about computer assisted reporting, I have to force myself to go back&nbsp;and read that report and to think about people such as Goldston.&nbsp;Goldston didn’t use it because she wanted to be awarded the&nbsp;</span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Mercury News</span><span class="font12"> golden pocket protector. She did it for the same&nbsp;reason pioneers such as Jaspin, Phil Meyer, and Rich Mauer&nbsp;began analyzing government databases - because it was the&nbsp;only way to do the stories they wanted to do.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">For me, computer assisted reporting provided a way to do journalism using computer techniques in a way that brought&nbsp;together my skills and interest in computers and journalism. I&nbsp;also wanted to prove my college adviser wrong. He told me in&nbsp;1983: “You will never be able to combine computers and journalism. You have to choose one or the other.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">I decided to ignore him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Early in my career, I met Jaspin and became enchanted with the notion of doing computer assisted reporting. I was able to get&nbsp;some free-lance jobs doing analysis for projects such as a project</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">looking at health care in Georgia for the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Atlanta Constitution </span><span class="font12">called “In Sickness and in Wealth.” I analyzed Heath Care Finance Administration data using mainframe SAS. I would wait&nbsp;several hours for my queries to run. My results would be a thick&nbsp;printout in the basement of the newspaper.</span></p><h4><a name="bookmark39"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Barriers to CAR</span></h4>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Lack of tools: </span><span class="font12">Ten years ago, the biggest barrier to using computer tools for reporting was getting the computers. Even&nbsp;when NICAR began training five years ago, computers were&nbsp;still a scarce commodity in most newsrooms. Until very recently&nbsp;this continued to be a problem. Luckily the end of the millennium has led many newsrooms to update their publishing systems&nbsp;to PC-based software.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The power of desktop data analysis makes computer assisted reporting much easier today. In many newsrooms reporters have&nbsp;access to spreadsheets, databases, and the Internet from their&nbsp;desktops.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Access: </span><span class="font12">Another barrier to early computer assisted reporting projects was the inability to get electronic information from government agencies. “We absolutely need an Electronic Freedom&nbsp;of Information Act,” Jaspin said in 1989. “There has to be some&nbsp;pretty strong language that says if information exists in computerized form, the requester has the right to get it that way.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Efforts also have been made to eliminate this barrier. The EFOIA makes electronic records subject to EFOIA, although reporters are still trying to see how much of an effect EFOIA really&nbsp;has had.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Skills: </span><span class="font12">The next barrier was developing the skills to do computer assisted reporting. Training programs such as the&nbsp;Missouri Institute for Computer Assisted Reporting (MICAR),&nbsp;the National Instituted for Advanced Reporting (NIAR), and the&nbsp;National Institute for Computer Assisted Reporting (NICAR)&nbsp;brought CAR skills into mainstream journalism. Thousands of&nbsp;journalists have been trained through boot camps, conferences,&nbsp;and seminars. Most reporters had some opportunity to learn&nbsp;CAR through these and other programs.</span></p><div><img src="when-nerds-and-words-collide_files/when-nerds-and-words-collide-16.jpg" style="width:67pt;height:85pt;"/>

<p><span class="font12">I am grateful I had the opportunity to be a part of the early NICAR training years and see the impact that organization has&nbsp;had on journalism nationally and internationally. I also wanted&nbsp;the opportunity to return to a newsroom and follow reporters&nbsp;from training through actual reporting projects. I returned to the&nbsp;</span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">San Jose Mercury News</span><span class="font12"> in 1995.</span></p><h4><a name="bookmark40"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Case study</span></h4>
<p><span class="font12">Newsroom management set forth a vision for the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Mercury News</span><span class="font12"> to be the “voice of Silicon Valley.” That meant that our internal technology literacy needed to be increased. The approach&nbsp;to research and computer assisted reporting tools has come from&nbsp;the newsroom with strong buy-in from the systems editor (a former reporter and editor). The goals early on were to:</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Get folks to use those boxes on their desks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evangelize - get folks excited.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Get as many tools as possible into their hands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Get stories into the paper.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">We began with a self-assessment of newsroom skill levels that showed a significant number of newsroom personnel had minimal or no Windows skills.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Our goal was to expose as many people as possible to the tools available through “basic training.” The basics included:&nbsp;Computer Basics/Windows, Microsoft Mail, Introduction to the&nbsp;Internet, Introduction to Excel, and Introduction to Access.&nbsp;Within the first year, about two-thirds of the newsroom had&nbsp;taken at least one class. Once they were trained, it was important&nbsp;to keep their skills shaip, so I conducted a lot of one-on-one&nbsp;training and obtained databases for particular reporters.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Training at the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Mercury News</span><span class="font12"> is not limited to reporters. All staff can benefit from these skills. Copy editors who are&nbsp;exposed to these tools tend to edit CAR stories better. The make-or-break group that needs training is assigning editors: If they&nbsp;support CAR, reporters will use it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">A key move early in the process was to train top management. We offered a weekend “data retreat” where we talked about&nbsp;story ideas and managing CAR, and conducted hands-on training. Other related training includes math brown bag lunches and&nbsp;sessions by our lawyers on legal issues.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">I also learned how important follow-up is to developing CAR skills. Reporters can take classes forever, but until they actually&nbsp;get through the pitfalls of their first project, their skills really&nbsp;never become ingrained.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Mercury News’s</span><span class="font12"> approach to computer assisted reporting is to give reporters the tools and the help they need to use as&nbsp;many of those tools themselves as they can. We don’t have an&nbsp;analysis department that feeds printouts to reporters because we&nbsp;believe analysis is part of the reporting process.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">We’re now reaping the benefits of that approach, because CAR skills are more widespread. At any given time at least 10&nbsp;people are working on some sort of story using CAR tools.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Training, data, and stories all contribute to getting the word out. But repetition never hurts. We developed an irreverent&nbsp;monthly computer assisted reporting newsletter. The newsletter,&nbsp;along with tip sheets, the style guide, and other resources, is on&nbsp;the company intranet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">We also offer frequent brown bag lunches with outside speakers discussing what their organizations are doing with&nbsp;CAR. This helps to get people excited.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Money provides incentive. We give a quarterly cash award for computer assisted reporting. This helps CAR be recognized as&nbsp;an important reporting tool. (And not just because of the money.&nbsp;It also sends the message that if management is willing to give&nbsp;money for good CAR, it must be important.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Acquisition of data was more work on the local level than I had expected. We’ve faced difficult battles with the city of San&nbsp;Jose and other local and state jurisdictions for even the most&nbsp;basic data. We pursued a two-year fight for pet license data in&nbsp;San Jose, which we ended up losing in court. As a result, several&nbsp;news organizations in California have joined forces against&nbsp;some state agencies for data.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">All of our reference databases are on SQL server, accessible via a web browser from all desktops. This data initially was in&nbsp;Access with front-ends, but the system was just too overloaded.&nbsp;SQL server is faster and easier to use. Our reference databases&nbsp;include voter registration, business licenses, campaign finances,&nbsp;and corporations data.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The next step was to work with bureaus and city/county reporters to acquire their own “resource” data. We’ve begun a&nbsp;strong effort in one of our larger, more CAR-savvy bureaus. We&nbsp;hope it will be a model for the rest of the newsroom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">At this point, most folks are able to use the Internet on their own, with help now and then on search techniques. Other tools&nbsp;such as databases and spreadsheets are being used regularly by a&nbsp;core of about 40 people. That number is slowly increasing. More&nbsp;advanced tools such as mapping and statistical programs are&nbsp;beginning to be used by our early adopters.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The key has been to train assigning editors about CAR tools. The reporters who do the most CAR work report to editors who&nbsp;understand the tools. For example, our education editor&nbsp;demanded that all her reporters take classes and won’t hire&nbsp;anyone without basic CAR understanding. She now has several&nbsp;people who regularly use databases. One even uses statistical&nbsp;analyses frequently. (They call him “data boy.”)</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">We’ve tried to avoid the “magic wand syndrome” when folks want to do a complex project very quickly and promise way too&nbsp;much, too fast. As a solution to that, the new projects review&nbsp;process requires that folks check with the database editor before&nbsp;submitting their initial budgets. The database editor is also part&nbsp;of the projects review committee.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">We’ve had some great success stories. A good example is our road transportation reporter, “Mr. Roadshow.” When he first&nbsp;came to training, he’d ask: “OK, so do I turn the computer on&nbsp;now?” Several stories later, he has truly integrated CAR into his&nbsp;beat. When there’s an accident on a particular road, he now&nbsp;checks the accident database to find how often accidents have&nbsp;occurred at that spot. He’s also one of the most positive people&nbsp;in the newsroom and has served as a model for others.</span></p><h4><a name="bookmark41"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Where is computer assisted reporting today?</span></h4>
<p><span class="font12">At the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Mercury News,</span><span class="font12"> CAR is a valued tool for everyone. And although not everyone uses it, most folks think they should be.&nbsp;I’m not sure all newsrooms work that way. I think many newsrooms follow the old model of someone working magic in the&nbsp;corner and providing reporters with results. That does more&nbsp;harm than good. When the great and powerful Oz in the corner&nbsp;leaves for a better job, the newsroom is back to square one.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Ego is a big part of elitist CAR. Some CAR geeks still think most reporters are too stupid to really learn CAR. Good&nbsp;reporters can learn basic CAR skills and make use of them in&nbsp;their reporting. Some complicated tasks, such as data cleaning</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">and statistical analysis, may not become mainstream for a long time, but basic spreadsheet and database work can be used by&nbsp;the entire newsroom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Some reporters think they are “above” some CAR skills. To some, CAR is not seen as reporting, but rather as a clerical&nbsp;function that doesn’t deserve the credit awarded to traditional&nbsp;reporting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The definition of CAR itself is now somewhat confusing. Frequently, students visiting the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Mercury News</span><span class="font12"> say they do computer assisted reporting. When I ask more about what they do, they usually say they make web pages.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The term computer assisted reporting is confusing in the age of the Internet. Is it data analysis? Is it publishing electronic information? Is it searching the Internet?</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">I usually define computer assisted reporting as analyzing data to do stories that reporters couldn’t do any other way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">In some cases, the news organization’s online arm makes better use of databases than the traditional newsroom. There is a&nbsp;disconnect between newsroom staff and online folks in an area&nbsp;where so much potential exists. In some cases, newsroom staff&nbsp;are interested in adding depth to their projects using online&nbsp;resources, but the online side shows little interest. In other cases,&nbsp;the online staff wants to develop in-depth online projects, but the&nbsp;newsroom is not interested in working with them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">There’s no question today that editors know CAR is important. I’m just not sure they always know why. Many newsroom managers still don’t understand enough to know how to&nbsp;evaluate whether someone has the skills.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Some journalists face a lack of understanding by newsroom systems administrators, who put unreasonable restrictions on&nbsp;computer use. Folks in one newsroom were not allowed to use&nbsp;the floppy drives on their computers; others were not given Internet browsers because they might “play” on the Internet. These&nbsp;restrictions are ridiculous. Should we take away reporters’ telephones because they might call a friend, or remove their pencils&nbsp;because they might waste time doodling?</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Overall, we’re not at the level I would have expected 10 years ago. Although newsrooms have significant groups of CAR&nbsp;users, CAR is not widespread. Those who have been pioneers in&nbsp;this field should lead the way to integrate CAR tools to the&nbsp;extent that writing an essay about computer assisted reporting&nbsp;will seem as silly as writing an essay about telephone assisted&nbsp;reporting would seem today.</span></p><div>

<p><span class="font12">More than 13 years ago, Jaspin said: “The power of this thing is unbelievable...Newspapers are either going to 81311 doing&nbsp;what we do, or they’re going to be bypassed and out-of-date.”&nbsp;We’re making progress, but we’re not quite there yet.</span></p><h3><a name="bookmark13"></a><span class="font19">Objects in Mirror Are Closer Than They Appear</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">By George Landau</span></p><h4><a name="bookmark42"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">In praise of leather</span></h4>
<p><span class="font12">It was my pal Dan Browning, now the CAR guru at the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Star Tribune</span><span class="font12"> in Minneapolis, who said that we geeks have “the best&nbsp;job in journalism.” He’s right. We get to rummage through&nbsp;electronic filing cabinets in the name of authoritative repotting,&nbsp;we engage in an endless battle with snarled data, and we get to&nbsp;buy new toys more often than anybody else in the newsroom.&nbsp;It’s a sweet career for anyone, and I owe mine almost entirely to&nbsp;the Leather Goddesses of Phobos.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">I was 24 years old in early 1989 when Elliot Jaspin came to town spouting tales of corrupt Rhode Island politicians and&nbsp;reckless bus drivers whom he’d lassoed with spools of 9-track&nbsp;tape. Jaspin was about to start the Missouri Institute for&nbsp;Computer Assisted Reporting in Columbia, Mo. My bosses at&nbsp;the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">St. Louis Post-Dispatch</span><span class="font12"> had hired him for a couple of days to&nbsp;help them choose someone to do computer assisted repotting&nbsp;full time. Only a handful of newspapers had reporters dedicated&nbsp;to CAR in those days, and it was only through the wisdom of&nbsp;projects editor Richard Weil (now the managing editor) that the&nbsp;</span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Post-Dispatch</span><span class="font12"> was getting into the game early. It didn’t hurt that&nbsp;a publisher named Ralph Ingersoll had announced plans to start&nbsp;a new daily, the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">St. Louis Sun.</span><span class="font12"> Ingersoll’s competitive threat,&nbsp;which disappeared in a cloud of bankruptcy after just a seven-month run, prompted a brief spurt of newsroom improvements&nbsp;at the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Post-Dispatch,</span><span class="font12"> and Weil managed to sneak computer&nbsp;assisted reporting into the mix.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">I’d spent about five years in full- and part-time gigs at the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Post-Dispatch,</span><span class="font12"> writing features, working general assignment,&nbsp;and rotating through the suburban bureaus. When Weil first&nbsp;asked me if I’d be interested in the job, I knew nothing about&nbsp;computer assisted reporting and next to nothing about relational&nbsp;databases. But it sounded like my dream job, so I bought some&nbsp;books, started reading feverishly, and nervously awaited the&nbsp;interview. As I recall, two or three other folks were being considered for the job. One of them was an import they’d flown in&nbsp;from Atlanta, which made me suspect that my own chances&nbsp;were slim.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">In the interview, Jaspin asked most of the questions. The newsroom honchos sat to the side, taking notes. I sweated and tried to sound knowledgeable about relational database theory, but it was&nbsp;clear to everyone that I didn’t know what I was talking about.&nbsp;Near the end of the ordeal, Jaspin asked me if I played computer&nbsp;games. Uh-oh, I thought, he’s making chitchat, which means I’m&nbsp;done for. I said no, not much, although I did enjoy those text-based adventure games, the ones where you have to type your&nbsp;way out of a densely plotted labyrinth. I mentioned “Leather&nbsp;Goddesses of Phobos,” from whom I had been trying to escape&nbsp;for the last few days. I said I didn’t know much about the truly&nbsp;cool games, the ones that had stunning graphics and aerial dogfights. Jaspin smiled politely and said, “Thanks, we’ll get back to&nbsp;you.” I felt like a game show contestant who had struck out and&nbsp;was being sent home with the vacuum cleaner consolation prize.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">I returned sullenly to my desk in the newsroom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">When he later told me I had the job, Weil explained that “Leather Goddesses” had been the clincher. Jaspin had read&nbsp;somewhere that people who enjoyed those text-based mazes&nbsp;were supposed to be good at programming and problemsolving. I was flabbergasted but not inclined to argue.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Over the next 10 years, I became so distracted with data and its distribution in a newsroom that I never found my way off&nbsp;Phobos. Some things are better left as mysteries.</span></p><h4><a name="bookmark43"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Beyond leather</span></h4>
<p><span class="font12">If the preceding narrative has a purpose beyond nostalgia, it’s to illustrate that you don’t need to know anything about&nbsp;computer assisted reporting in order to learn it, master it, and&nbsp;enjoy it. If there’s one principle that has guided me for the last 10&nbsp;years, and which has never failed to unknot my gut in the face of&nbsp;the most intimidating obstacles, it’s that in this field, you can’t&nbsp;ever let yourself believe that you’re done learning.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">What makes CAR the best job in journalism is that the need for constant learning applies equally to reporting and to computers. You can’t be a good reporter if you’ve lost the ability to ask&nbsp;questions and find answers, and you can’t squeeze knowledge&nbsp;from a PC unless you know how to use the software to explore&nbsp;and organize the data. And since the stories and the software are&nbsp;constantly changing, CAR specialists never rest. It’s probably&nbsp;the only career that has so much built-in protection against&nbsp;senile dementia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">When I look back on my 10 years in the field of computer assisted reporting, I see a clear progression from one to many -from starting as a solo act (the guru phase), to building a CAR&nbsp;infrastructure in my newsroom (the engineer phase), to building&nbsp;a set of CAR tools intended for newsrooms everywhere (the entrepreneur phase).</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">I’m not entirely sure about this, but I think that my particular career path and the course of the CAR field itself have been&nbsp;shaped by the same external factor: the availability of networked&nbsp;personal computers. As the network has grown, the role of the&nbsp;CAR specialist has transformed from gura-on-the-mountaintop&nbsp;to a mix of highway engineer and gas station attendant.</span></p><h4><a name="bookmark44"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">A tight grip on the wheel</span></h4>
<p><span class="font12">Back in 1989,1 had the only remotely speedy PC in the entire </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Post-Dispatch</span><span class="font12"> newsroom, so there wasn’t much of an alternative to my becoming a solo act. That’s not all bad, because it</span></p><div>

<p><span class="font2">George Landau is president of NewsEngin Inc. (<a href="http://www.NewsEngin.com">http://www.NewsEngin.com</a>), a St. Louis-based&nbsp;company that provides newsrooms with&nbsp;knowledge-management software, including&nbsp;several tools for computer assisted reporting.&nbsp;Before founding NewsEngin in 1996, he oversaw&nbsp;the CAR program at the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">St Louis Post-Dispatch.</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
<p><span class="font12">allowed me to log a lot of hours learning this stuff. In fact, I am only slightly ashamed to confess, I found the guru role intoxicating, as if I were starring in my own </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Revenge of the Nerds.</span><span class="font12"> Jaspin&nbsp;used to quote the adage, “In the kingdom of the blind, the one-eyed man is king.” I was enjoying my royal status, collaborating&nbsp;with the newspaper’s best reporters on its most important&nbsp;stories, pulling levers and pushing buttons whose function&nbsp;remained an utter mystery even to my bosses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Fortunately, this phase didn’t last. After a year or two as a solo performer, I began to see that this guru thing was over-rated. In&nbsp;fact, it was becoming acutely painful. Each successful CAR story&nbsp;that went into the paper seemed to provoke several new proposals&nbsp;as reporters and editors began to recognize the potential of computer analysis. Having to tell my colleagues, “No, I don’t have&nbsp;time” put my stomach in knots. I certainly didn’t want to hold the&nbsp;entire newsroom back from this wonderful new resource.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Slowly, it began to dawn on me that the success of CAR (and my own success) depended not on how cleverly I could crunch&nbsp;data for a particular story. More important was how effectively I&nbsp;could share these new resources with my colleagues. In fact,&nbsp;since I understood the value of computers to journalism better&nbsp;than perhaps anyone else in the newsroom, I felt I had a responsibility to lobby for change.</span></p><h4><a name="bookmark45"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Building a roadway and handing out car keys</span></h4>
<p><span class="font12">My lobbying fell on sympathetic ears, and in 1993 I got a new job title (the deadly “Manager of Information Technology”) and&nbsp;some help in the CAR guru department. Over the next couple of&nbsp;years we put PCs on more than 100 desks, all of them connected&nbsp;by this miraculous thing called a network. The network was&nbsp;strung haphazardly, with all of the cables converging to form a&nbsp;fire hazard in a corner of my crowded office. We sought guidance but received none from the newspaper’s moribund Information Systems Department. For networking software, we were&nbsp;using nothing but Windows for Workgroups, because it came&nbsp;free with the new PCs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Making use of the network, we built a Visual Basic application that allowed reporters to search driver’s licenses and vehicle registrations from their desks. We built another VB application that let them search and monitor all of the wire feeds. We taught reporters how to use spreadsheets and database software,&nbsp;and a few of them heartily embraced these tools (the remainder&nbsp;at least knew what the tools could do). The office network began to change the way CAR gurus worked with other journalists. (You still need experts even in a collaborative world.) Now&nbsp;the guru could handle the difficult task of obtaining the data and&nbsp;preparing it for analysis, but the other reporters could query the&nbsp;data directly, building their own analytical muscles in the&nbsp;process.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">As more reporters began to work in this way, analyzing data over the office network, it became clear that we needed a better&nbsp;way to manage the raw data. Using Microsoft Access to query a&nbsp;large database on a fileserver was painfully slow, since all of that&nbsp;data had to pass through the relatively narrow network pipes. So&nbsp;in 1995, we took the plunge into “client/server,” buying a beefy&nbsp;PC equipped with Microsoft SQL Server. This provided snappier performance by executing all of the actual queries on the</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">beefy PC (the server), passing only the query statements and result sets back and forth over the wire.</span></p><h4><a name="bookmark46"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The highway and a rig called Lotus Notes</span></h4>
<p><span class="font12">The network started to get a lot bigger in 1995, and so did the opportunities for an ambitious CAR program. Our newsroom&nbsp;got plugged directly onto the Internet, and the web was fast becoming a valuable research tool. The web browser began to&nbsp;make sense as a way to deploy internal databases, too. So using&nbsp;some Microsoft freebies, we migrated those old VB applications&nbsp;to our intranet, making it far easier for reporters to look up&nbsp;driver’s licenses, registrations, vital records, and so on.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Also in 1995, we started playing with an incredible product called Lotus Notes. I’d had my eye on Notes for several years,&nbsp;because from what I read in the trade magazines, it looked like&nbsp;an ideal platform on which to build a variety of newsroom tools,&nbsp;perhaps even an entire editorial system. For the next year or so, I&nbsp;oversaw the development of several Notes applications that&nbsp;formed the core production tools for the newspaper’s website. It&nbsp;was during this period that I began to see something that looked&nbsp;a lot like the big picture.</span></p><h4><a name="bookmark47"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Interstate commerce</span></h4>
<p><span class="font12">Big ideas began to percolate at the 1996 conference of Investigative Reporters and Editors in Providence, R.I. Night after night, beer after beer, it became obvious that lots of us CAR&nbsp;nerds were wrestling with the same challenges - how to use the&nbsp;tools of the Internet (web browsers and the network itself) to&nbsp;share knowledge within our newsrooms. What was the best way&nbsp;to put relational databases on an internal web page? What about&nbsp;other kinds of data?</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">On my return from Providence, the big picture revealed itself in full: I saw the newsroom as a funnel through which huge&nbsp;amounts of a community’s information flowed every day like&nbsp;crude oil. Atypical newsroom was nothing but an antiquated, inefficient knowledge refinery. Reporters were technologically ill-equipped for this flood of raw information, in which ever-larger&nbsp;quantities were arriving in digital form. Clearly, outfitting those&nbsp;journalists with modern information-management tools had&nbsp;become an urgent, competitive necessity for the news industry.&nbsp;Clear to me, anyway.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">In a series of impassioned memos and meetings, I tried to persuade my publisher that journalism faced a dire need, which&nbsp;in turn presented an opportunity to whoever might meet it. The&nbsp;need was for a two-pronged attack on information overload.&nbsp;Someone needed to develop software that made it easier to share&nbsp;relational databases (highly structured information about things&nbsp;and people) within a newsroom. And someone needed to make it&nbsp;easier for journalists to gather, organize, search, and share other&nbsp;kinds of information (more loosely structured things such as&nbsp;interview notes, e-mail, wire stories, and source documents).</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">After three months it was apparent that the publisher wouldn’t be making up his mind anytime soon. But I was convinced that&nbsp;this was one of those once-in-a-lifetime opportunities. I was&nbsp;lucky enough to be in a position from which I could see farther&nbsp;down the road than some of my colleagues. I was certain that&nbsp;one day in the not-so-distant future, all newsrooms would be</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">29</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
<p><span class="font12">equipped with something similar to the tools that I envisioned. The question for me was simply who would get to build those&nbsp;tools, and when. I realized that if I didn’t give it a try, I would&nbsp;never forgive myself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">So in late 1996,1 quit my job at the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Post-Dispatch</span><span class="font12"> and started a little company called NewsEngin Inc. Two years later, News-Engin has a strong array of knowledge-management tools up&nbsp;and running in more than a dozen newsrooms across the country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">We have a popular application called UniQuery that makes it easy for newsrooms to put relational databases on an intranet.&nbsp;UniQuery performs global searches, so that web users can type</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">in a name or address and search every newsroom database with a single click. Hundreds of journalists are using our Source-Tracker software to build secure, fully searchable troves of contact information, interview notes, source documents, and stories.&nbsp;And more important, publishers have demonstrated a willingness to purchase and deploy these tools, especially when they&nbsp;come bundled with our versatile editorial front-end software&nbsp;(NewsFront, our Trojan horse for CAR).</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">So as the millennium approaches and the CAR landscape continues to change, I find myself fortunate to be part of the&nbsp;process.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Still the best job in journalism, hands down.</span></p><div>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">By Teresa Leonard</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Reporters at </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">The News &amp; Observer</span><span class="font12"> in Raleigh, N.C., have had every advantage. Since the early ’90s, they have had ready&nbsp;access to tremendous computing power and a direct connection&nbsp;to the Internet, more than 350 databases, extensive training&nbsp;opportunities, and a world-class intranet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">And like a bunch of spoiled brats, they take it for granted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Since 1996, nine reporters have enjoyed a monthlong CAR fellowship during which they are expected to produce nothing,&nbsp;but to learn, the idea being that they will emerge as full-fledged&nbsp;CAR reporters and begin to plow through databases with lightning intensity, racking up Pulitzer after Pulitzer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">These fellowship graduates have put a combined total of 27 CAR stories in the paper. That’s one per year per graduate. This&nbsp;isn’t exactly what we had planned.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">But it’s also not the entire picture.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Although </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">The News &amp; Observer</span><span class="font12"> has enjoyed a reputation as a mecca for computer assisted reporting and for technological&nbsp;innovation, we didn’t always have it so good. When Pat Stith got&nbsp;the database bug at an IRE conference, he found willing&nbsp;converts among the library staff. We had been working with&nbsp;databases and had an inkling of how powerful they could be.&nbsp;Newsroom management, however, was a little less enlightened.&nbsp;The managing editor’s response was, “We sure don’t want Pat&nbsp;Stith touching a computer.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Actually, he was able to persuade management that building a database of campaign contributions for the upcoming Senate&nbsp;contest between Jesse Helms and Harvey Gantt would be worthwhile. In fact, Pat’s brother had some technical expertise and&nbsp;could help us build such a database. There was a hoity-toity&nbsp;lunch with the big guys, all on their best behavior.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Then reality set in. The project was big and it was time consuming. Interest began to cool, as did the reception Pat’s brother received in the newsroom. In fact, they took to sneaking in on&nbsp;weekends to work on this project. It was grassroots determination rather than direction from management that got that first&nbsp;database built and its stories in the paper.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Of course, our legendary big break came with the changing of the guard. Frank Daniels III understood the power of databases&nbsp;in all aspects of business. It also didn’t hurt that he was fascinated by the latest gizmos and he really </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">really</span><span class="font12"> liked national (or&nbsp;more) recognition for the company. We were only too happy to&nbsp;oblige.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">We began to buy PCs. We began to hire people. And when the Internet came over the horizon, we were there! During this time&nbsp;we identified and put into place several initiatives to promote&nbsp;CAR among the news staff. One of the most radical and beneficial of these was a computer loan program in which employees&nbsp;received interest-free loans for the purchase of a computer. This&nbsp;idea came from the understanding that in order to learn to use a&nbsp;computer to its fullest potential, a journalist needed access,&nbsp;preferably in his home or on his desk. Having all the tools in&nbsp;place, we set our sights toward putting stories in the paper.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Our philosophy about computer assisted reporting has always been that the stories should drive the databases, not the other&nbsp;way around. So we don’t make a big splash over technique or&nbsp;state in the newspaper that a story is computer assisted. This can&nbsp;sometimes make CAR stories difficult to identify. There also&nbsp;can be some fuzziness about what counts as a CAR story. Do&nbsp;multiple stories from the same database count multiple times?&nbsp;Do spreadsheets count? How about database lookups or online&nbsp;searches? The definition we settled on for a CAR story is one&nbsp;that uses data from a database or spreadsheet, homemade or&nbsp;acquired. This does not include a story written on a computer,&nbsp;interviews conducted over e-mail, or background material gathered through online searches of other publications.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">We did want to quantify our work, however, so we track CAR stories in our electronic archive. After just a handful in 1990, our&nbsp;production went up to 47 the next year to a record high of 82 in&nbsp;1993. Because of the inexact nature of our count, along with&nbsp;differing opinions over the years regarding which stories to&nbsp;count, it may be more illustrative to state that we’ve published&nbsp;an average of 57 CAR stories per year for the past eight years.&nbsp;CAR stories have spanned just about every desk - metro,&nbsp;government, business, sports, features. We even published a&nbsp;computer assisted bridal section!</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Another chapter in our CAR history is the various staff configurations we’ve tried out over the years. We’ve had a database editor based in the news research department, a CAR editor in&nbsp;the newsroom, and a triad of editors reporting to different&nbsp;departments with nobody in charge. We’ve also had a variety of&nbsp;skills in those jobs, from bona fide computer nerd to statistician&nbsp;to old-school investigative reporter. All of these arrangements&nbsp;have helped to shape the configuration we have today - a database manager, assigned to news research, who maintains our PC&nbsp;network, oversees the acquisition and loading of databases, and&nbsp;builds front-end tools for ready reference access to some databases. While the database manager also works with reporters in&nbsp;analyzing databases and doing the stories, this is slowly&nbsp;becoming a research function that will involve all of our news&nbsp;researchers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Of course, training is vital to our CAR program. As with staffing, we’ve tried every approach to training invented. We’ve&nbsp;done weeklong classes, private tutorials, and intensive week-long and monthlong CAR fellowships. During the fellowships,&nbsp;reporters and editors are exposed to all of the electronic&nbsp;resources and research tools available at </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">The News &amp; Observer.</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font2">Teresa Leonard came to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The News &amp; Observer </span><span class="font2">the day after graduating from UNO's School of&nbsp;Information and Library Science in 1987. In 1993,&nbsp;she became director of the news research department. The work of that department includes&nbsp;the creation of the paper's electronic searchable&nbsp;archives, reference and research services to the&nbsp;newsroom, creation of the company’s intranet,&nbsp;and computer assisted reporting.</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div><img src="when-nerds-and-words-collide_files/when-nerds-and-words-collide-18.jpg" style="width:64pt;height:84pt;"/></div><br clear="all"/><div>

<p><span class="font19">The State of CAR as Seen from The News &amp; Observer</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
<p><span class="font12">More importantly, they are given lots of hands-on practice time. They analyze databases with the purpose of seeing how to ask&nbsp;the question and without the pressure of having to come up with&nbsp;a story. Our CAR fellowships have had mixed success. While&nbsp;some of our graduates have moved on to other papers or into&nbsp;editor positions (not veiy helpful to our CAR statistics), we have&nbsp;others who are doing then<sup>-</sup> own day-to-day computer research&nbsp;with public records databases. News research’s approach to&nbsp;training and practice in computer assisted reporting is the same&nbsp;as our research policy. We will help reporters to the extent that&nbsp;they need help, depending on their skills and time pressures.&nbsp;They can do their own database work start to finish, they get&nbsp;help from a researcher when needed, or they can ask us to do it&nbsp;for them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">So what we’ve learned from our long and sordid history with CAR is that there is no one formula. No one approach works for&nbsp;everybody all the time. It doesn’t even work for us all the time.&nbsp;We’ve had to tailor our program to the personalities and skills&nbsp;and stories involved. And while those 27 stories produced by&nbsp;CAR graduates might sound like an insufficient return, it doesn’t&nbsp;take into account reporters who are using CAR in small ways on&nbsp;a daily basis, often because it has been introduced to them as one&nbsp;of many tools.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">From the early days of CAR, its proponents have insisted that it is “just another tool,” always comparing it to the telephone.&nbsp;Today’s journalist wouldn’t think of reporting without using the&nbsp;telephone and certainly doesn’t see fit to draw attention to its&nbsp;contribution to the story. What we’ve failed to do in making this&nbsp;analogy is to put it in perspective. Computer assisted reporting is&nbsp;hard and it’s time consuming. A big database analysis, like</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">in-depth interviews and extensive travel, may not be appropriate for some stories, but thinking about databases always has a&nbsp;potential payoff.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Of course, even when the story is worth it, you’ll find journalists trying to get something for nothing. You will always&nbsp;have to contend with editors who want results with no investment of their reporters’ time, and reporters who want results&nbsp;with no investment of effort. The best CAR reporters are the&nbsp;same ones who are the best investigative reporters or the best&nbsp;sports reporters or the best police reporters.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">CAR also needs to become an everyday research tool. News research departments spend their money and energy on anticipating newsroom needs and building the resources to meet those&nbsp;needs. Perfect examples are our book collections and the newspaper archives. The expertise at work here can also be applied to&nbsp;identifying useful databases and making them accessible and&nbsp;searchable through intranets or local area networks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">So the continuing issues for CAR in our newsroom are persistence and flexibility, both in training and in practice. The news research department has helped to provide the persistence to&nbsp;maintain our focus on CAR in light of the latest newsroom fads.&nbsp;We also provide a turf-neutral environment in which reporters&nbsp;get priority for their stories and a commitment to training. What&nbsp;we cannot provide, in the political reality of newsrooms, is the&nbsp;influence to push for the growth of computer assisted reporting.&nbsp;We are developing a bigger role in recognizing CAR opportunities and pointing them out to the newsroom, but we can’t “make&nbsp;them drink.” But neither can editors. A CAR program cannot&nbsp;exist without commitment from the top, but it cannot thrive&nbsp;without the drive of the reporters.</span></p><div>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">By Stephen C. Miller</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">I started doing computer assisted reporting by accident. I didn’t even know that I was doing a form of CAR until I went to&nbsp;the first NICAR conference in Raleigh, N.C. Of course, I had to&nbsp;twist the definition of CAR to fit what I was doing and not what,&nbsp;at that time, everyone else was still calling “Database Journalism.” I took the words literally: that CAR meant using a computer to assist in reporting. I hadn’t done a big database project or&nbsp;spent weeks crunching numbers to make connections that were&nbsp;not possible before computerization. In fact, when I started doing CAR in 1982,1 was just trying to make enough money as a&nbsp;free-lancer to support my family.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The only way I found to do that was to crank out multiple versions of the same story for different magazines, and the only way to do that was to use a personal computer and CAR techniques. Of course, I was a sort of idiot savant of CAR because I&nbsp;didn’t even know that was what I was doing. I was just making it&nbsp;up as I went along because I had to. And what I was making up&nbsp;was using CAR for daily journalism, not projects.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">I started using my PC to short circuit some time-consuming processes that kept me from writing. I stopped going to the&nbsp;library when I discovered that I could get a cheap version of&nbsp;Dialog through CompuServe. I didn’t know that I was querying&nbsp;a database, I just knew that I could get background information&nbsp;without wasting a couple of hours traveling to the library.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">I learned to use a spreadsheet, not because I saw the journalistic possibilities, but because I was doing a story about&nbsp;this upstart company called Lotus Development and some&nbsp;computer program called 1-2-3 that was exciting to all the&nbsp;accountants.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">I used the spreadsheet for the first time to analyze data because I was online to the Department of Education’s bulletin&nbsp;board service, and they had all these statistics in files that could&nbsp;only be read with a spreadsheet. And once I opened the files, all&nbsp;that stuff I had learned about Lotus 1-2-3 suddenly made sense.&nbsp;When I started looking at the numbers in different ways, I saw&nbsp;that I could sell three more pieces based on just sorting the data.&nbsp;I even figured out that the graphing capabilities of Lotus could&nbsp;help me sell pieces to all those math-phobic editors. They were&nbsp;impressed that I could visualize the data for them and not hit&nbsp;them with a lot of mind-numbing numbers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">I was stunned when I found out that other people were not only using some of the techniques that I had fumbled through,&nbsp;but were using it in a clear, systematic way to do “real” reporting&nbsp;and not the quick knockoffs for a 800-word magazine piece.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">After attending a few conferences, it hit me that there had been a fundamental change in how news was gathered and&nbsp;processed, and it happened while most of us were too busy&nbsp;reacting to breaking news to notice. And, for the first time, the&nbsp;changes were not driven by management’s desire to cut costs&nbsp;with automation. Computers were first put in newsroom not to&nbsp;do better journalism, but to save money by getting rid of the&nbsp;typographers’ union.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">In fact, how journalism was altered had nothing at all to do with the news business. It had to do with the development of the&nbsp;personal computer and the sophisticated business programs that&nbsp;run on it such as word processors, spreadsheets, and databases.&nbsp;It also grew from advances in telecommunications - the ability&nbsp;to quickly transmit information over standard phone lines and to&nbsp;be able to interact with millions of computers around the world.&nbsp;And it grew out of some weird, spontaneous desire to put online&nbsp;every scrap of information known to man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Today’s journalist is likely to carry a laptop loaded with a word processor, a communications program, a spreadsheet, a&nbsp;database, and a contact manager. The story will be transmitted&nbsp;from the scene over a cellular telephone or even a portable satellite dish.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">While hardware and software play a big part in altering journalism, the major change is where information resides and&nbsp;how journalists get to it. Online databases and the Internet are&nbsp;vast storehouses of information that reporters and editors can tap&nbsp;into in an instant to add greater depth to stories. Even the nature&nbsp;of interviewing has been altered with the use of electronic mail.&nbsp;I’ve just about eliminated telephone tag by doing most of my&nbsp;interviews via e-mail.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">But most reporters and editors are behind the curve in utilizing all the technology to commit better journalism. One of&nbsp;the reasons is lack of knowledge and training. Training is not a&nbsp;priority in most newsrooms. “Here’s your workstation; press&nbsp;that key to start a new story and, when you’re finished, press that&nbsp;key and it’ll go to your editor.” Young reporters are tossed into&nbsp;the deep end of the pool and are expected to learn the tricks of&nbsp;the trade by osmosis. Even seasoned reporters get stuck in ruts&nbsp;because there is usually no continuing training at their&nbsp;organizations. And of course, there’s denial: “Look, I get a piece&nbsp;in the paper every day. What do I need to learn all this new stuff&nbsp;for?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Another reason for not using the technology is computer phobia. Even in the middle of the “information age” there are&nbsp;still lots of people, in and out of the news business, who are&nbsp;intimidated and frightened by computers. Geekspeak, compu-babble, and TLAs have done nothing to ease anyone’s fear of&nbsp;computers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>1</sup> Three Letter Acronyms. The computer industry loves to compress complex terminology into TLAs - DOS, RAM, ROM, COM, EXE, MHz, BPS, etc. If you're stuck at a party with some alleged computing expert, ask him/her if there a difference between baud rate and bits per second. If they say none, take their advice with a large&nbsp;grain of salt. If you really want to know the difference, look it up online.</span></p><div><img src="when-nerds-and-words-collide_files/when-nerds-and-words-collide-19.jpg" style="width:67pt;height:85pt;"/>
<p><span class="font2">Stephen C. Miller is assistant technology editor at </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The New York Times.</span><span class="font2"> His job is to assist reporters&nbsp;and editors in utilizing technology to enhance the&nbsp;newsgathering effort. He also writes frequently&nbsp;about technology. Since 1982 he has been using&nbsp;computers to aid in his reporting. Before joining&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The New York Times,</span><span class="font2"> he wrote about computers&nbsp;and consumer electronics for various publications.</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">33</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
<p><span class="font12">The most serious problem with moving forward is that management too often just doesn’t get it and can’t admit it. Most&nbsp;senior managers of news organizations grew up during an era&nbsp;when all a foreign correspondent needed was a notebook, a pencil, and enough money to bribe a telex operator. They’ve never&nbsp;had to use the technology in the field themselves, so it’s alien to&nbsp;them. And if you’re running a major news organization, can you&nbsp;admit that some snot-nosed kid fresh out of college knows more&nbsp;about the technology than you do? “Hey, kid, come here and&nbsp;teach me how to analyze the mayor’s budget using a spreadsheet.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">I once asked a group of journalism students at a major university how many knew what a telex was, and got no response. I asked that same group if any of them had an e-mail account.&nbsp;Every hand went up. At a conference of senior news managers, I&nbsp;asked the same questions. Everyone knew what a telex was, but&nbsp;only a third of the group had an e-mail account. I also asked&nbsp;those who did have an e-mail account how often they used it.&nbsp;Most used it sporadically, and one had never used it.</span></p><h4><a name="bookmark49"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Putting technology to work</span></h4>
<p><span class="font12">1992 was the first year that </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">The New York Times</span><span class="font12"> used PCs and Local Area Networking (LAN) technology to cover the political&nbsp;conventions. In addition to word processing and communications software for writing and filing, we had electronic access to&nbsp;all the wire services and all the major online databases: Lexis-Nexis, Datatimes, Dialog, and Dow Jones News and Retrieval.&nbsp;Because the system was relatively new, a series of classes were&nbsp;scheduled for anyone who wanted lessons in using all the new&nbsp;toys.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">No one showed up.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">A couple of days into one of the conventions, I noticed one of our top political reporters hovering over the fax machine. He&nbsp;was waiting for one of the clerks in Washington to fax him a&nbsp;copy of a wire story.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">“Why are you doing that?” I asked. “You can read the wires on your PC and even filter it so that you only get the stories&nbsp;you’re interested in.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">“I don’t have time for all that stuff. I just need to know how to write my stories and file them,” was the terse reply.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">“OK, let me get this straight. You’ve just made a costly longdistance phone call to D.C. to get a clerk to print out a wire story</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">from his computer. He then has to take the pages across the room to the fax machine and make a second costly long-distance&nbsp;call to this fax machine so you can read a wire story that can be&nbsp;displayed on your computer screen four feet away? And the reason for wasting all that time, not to mention the company’s money, is because you’re too lazy to learn how to read the wires on&nbsp;your PC?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Several years later, I had the same reporter in a class and discovered that he was terrified of computers and didn't want to&nbsp;appear stupid. He confessed that his </span><span class="font11">8</span><span class="font12">-year-old often helped him&nbsp;when he was forced to do something with the computer besides&nbsp;basic writing and filing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">It dawned on me that most reporters have no idea what they do for a living. I have been informally polling reporters and editors since then trying to get an idea of what they perceive as their&nbsp;jobs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Most journalists think of themselves as writers. While they go out and gather news, they perceive that their main function is to&nbsp;write. It’s actually just the opposite. Journalists spend the vast&nbsp;majority of their time gathering information. The amount of&nbsp;time spent on writing and filing takes up, at most, a couple of&nbsp;hours at the end of the day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">With the focus on writing, most reporters are inefficient news gatherers and analysts. That wasn’t much of a problem when&nbsp;most information was in some source’s head or printed on a&nbsp;piece of paper stuck in a file cabinet somewhere. If you had&nbsp;good sources who also could help you follow the paper trail, you&nbsp;could usually come up with a good story and scoop the competition. But the vast majority of information today is stored in a&nbsp;database and much of it is online.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Any reporter who thinks that the job of journalism can be practiced without CAR skills will shortly be out of work. That&nbsp;probably seems overstated, but the fact is that the pace of change&nbsp;has accelerated, and there is no sign that it is slowing down.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Two years ago, I got up in public and said that the Internet was an interesting concept, but that it would be years before it was&nbsp;useful to anyone but us geeks. I was wrong, really wrong.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">And those who think that journalism hasn’t changed and will be changed are looking in the wrong direction. Your back is&nbsp;turned.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">By Dwight Morris</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">For 18 of the past 22 years I have struggled to merge traditional reporting with in-depth data analysis. Plucked from graduate school in 1977 by </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">The New York Times</span><span class="font12"> to help an aging, irascible,&nbsp;and, to my mind, brilliant editor named Henry Lieberman bring&nbsp;what was then known as “precision journalism” to the paper,&nbsp;much of my career has been devoted to the design and execution&nbsp;of large data-driven investigative projects. Along the way I have&nbsp;been fortunate to have a hand in the development of one Pulitzer&nbsp;Prize winner at the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Journal-Constitution</span><span class="font12"> in Atlanta and a second&nbsp;Pulitzer finalist at the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Los Angeles Times.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">If there is one thing I can say with absolute certainty, it is that I despise the phrase “computer assisted reporting,” hereafter&nbsp;grudgingly referred to as CAR. My loathing of the phrase springs&nbsp;from the fact that its continued use serves to over-emphasize the&nbsp;importance of machines and software while largely ignoring the&nbsp;truly important factors that determine the success of any CAR&nbsp;project - critical thinking about one’s analysis plan and the ability to recognize and fix data problems before they become the&nbsp;subject of a retraction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Truth be told, I’m also not that wild about the phrase “precision journalism.” It strikes me as an unintentional slap at those who are not terribly computer literate but who nevertheless do&nbsp;their utmost to be precise at all times. As an alternative to both&nbsp;these labels, I offer the term “data-based reporting,” which places&nbsp;the emphasis where I believe it belongs - on understanding and&nbsp;explaining the mountains of information routinely used by government agencies at all levels in ways that impact public life. If as&nbsp;journalists you do nothing else, at least consider the following intellectual roadmap for getting started.</span></p><h4><a name="bookmark50"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Recognize that data are always dirty</span></h4>
<p><span class="font12">The first step in becoming a good data-based reporter is to recognize that we are largely powerless over those who&nbsp;construct and provide data. Databases are built to specifications&nbsp;that meet the needs of a particular government agency, which&nbsp;may or may not suit our reportorial needs. Among the linchpins&nbsp;in this database building process are data-entry operators who&nbsp;frequently know little about and could not care less about what&nbsp;they are keying. Their productivity, and therefore then job performance, is measured by how many keystrokes per hour they&nbsp;produce on average.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">As a result, if there is one thing you can be sure of, it is that all databases are dirty. As I write this, the Federal Election Commission’s campaign contribution database contains roughly&nbsp;$2 million more in soft money donations to the 1998 Republican&nbsp;House-Senate Dinner Committee than it should. A data-entry&nbsp;operator either ignored or misunderstood how memo entries&nbsp;should be handled and, as a result, double-keyed dozens of contributions. That error has gone unnoticed by the FEC for more&nbsp;than six months.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Far from being the exception, this is the unfortunate norm. Once errors are pointed out or discovered, the FEC takes fairly</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">swift action to correct them, but over the past year literally thousands of factual errors, both large and small, have been corrected at one point or another. If you happen to be one of the hundreds&nbsp;of journalists who uses the data for primary research on stories&nbsp;each year, you had better have a sufficient understanding of the&nbsp;rules governing contributions to spot potential errors and fix&nbsp;them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Whether any error in the FEC data is significant beyond the natural journalistic desire for complete accuracy depends largely&nbsp;upon whether one is writing about how much a particular&nbsp;committee or candidate raised or writing about how much soft&nbsp;money was raised by all party committees. In general, data&nbsp;problems are most acute when one is writing about a restricted&nbsp;“universe;” the smaller the focus of the story, the more critical&nbsp;the need for correcting even small errors.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">For example, following each of the past four election cycles I have examined federal donation records to determine how many&nbsp;Americans violated the $25,000 annual limit on contributions&nbsp;imposed as part of the post-Watergate reforms. While there have&nbsp;been well over 150 individuals who appeared to be in violation&nbsp;of federal contribution limits in each of the last two election&nbsp;cycles, roughly 25 percent of those scofflaws proved to be false&nbsp;positives due to reporting errors by party and candidate committees, as well as data entry errors by the FEC.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">During the 1992 election cycle, three members of one Chicago family appeared over the limit until we discovered that&nbsp;the National Republican Senatorial Committee had inadvertently filed three copies of the same page of one of its reports. The&nbsp;FEC dutifully keyed all the pages it received without noticing&nbsp;the duplicate page numbers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">As a result, a single $10,000 donation by each of the three individuals appeared in the FEC database as three $10,000 donations by each. Without rigid rules dictating that we double&nbsp;check all donations attributed to our targets, we easily could&nbsp;have branded three innocent people on the front page of the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Los&nbsp;Angeles Times.</span></p><h4><a name="bookmark51"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Recognize that data you need may be missing</span></h4>
<p><span class="font12">Lest one believe that the FEC is particularly incompetent, consider the case of the Resolution Trust Corporation (RTC), the&nbsp;now-defunct agency set up to dispose of assets originally held&nbsp;by failed savings and loans. In August 1991, Bob Rosenblatt, a&nbsp;reporter in the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Los Angeles Times’</span><span class="font12"> Washington bureau, and I&nbsp;decided to assess the performance of the RTC in recouping for</span></p><div><img src="when-nerds-and-words-collide_files/when-nerds-and-words-collide-20.jpg" style="width:64pt;height:84pt;"/>
<p><span class="font2">Dwight L. Morris is president of Campaign Study Group (CSG), a for-profit media consulting firm&nbsp;specializing in campaign finance analysis. During&nbsp;the 1996 and 1998 campaigns, he wrote Money&nbsp;Talk$, a column on campaign finance for wash-ingtonpost.com. For six years prior to founding&nbsp;CSG, Morris was editor for special investigations&nbsp;at the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Los Angeles Times'</span><span class="font2"> Washington bureau,&nbsp;where he designed numerous CAR projects.</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">35</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
<p><span class="font12">federal taxpayers the cost of the S&amp;L bailout. To pull off the project, we needed data on the original book value of assets held&nbsp;at the time any given S&amp;L went into bankruptcy; the reassessed&nbsp;value placed on the assets upon acquisition by the RTC; a sale&nbsp;price for any assets sold; and the names of the purchasers. As a&nbsp;starting point, we set up a meeting to interview the RTC’s director about what data he had and how it was kept.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">At that initial meeting Bob and I were told that no database existed. Depending upon one’s point of view that was technically the truth. While the centralized database was under construction,&nbsp;there were four regional databases at the time of our interview,&nbsp;not one national database of assets. Following that frustrating&nbsp;meeting we found a source within the agency who brought us up&nbsp;to speed, and armed with the proper terminology we were able to&nbsp;construct what we thought was an ironclad Freedom of Information request.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Nine months later we were informed that our request had been filled, and the next thing we knew, we were the proud&nbsp;owners of roughly 45,000 pieces of paper. The RTC had simply&nbsp;dumped the contents of all four regional computers, which satisfied the requirements of federal FOIA to provide us with “the&nbsp;record.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Rekeying that data into a usable database cost the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Los Angeles Times</span><span class="font12"> roughly $20,000, and I doubt seriously whether any other&nbsp;news organization would have bothered. I doubt seriously&nbsp;whether the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font12"> would do so today.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Armed with the data, we began to examine the quality of information we had been given. It was readily apparent that&nbsp;roughly one-quarter of the information required for the analysis&nbsp;was missing - some properties lacked an original book value,&nbsp;while others lacked a reassessed value, while still others lacked&nbsp;a sale price. Some properties lacked all three values. Given that&nbsp;the outcome of the study might be embarrassing or even politically damaging to the RTC, we decided that at least half the&nbsp;missing data had to be retrieved before we could proceed. Over&nbsp;the next month, the paper spent roughly $</span><span class="font11">10,000</span><span class="font12"> on property&nbsp;searches throughout the country. Once we knocked the missing&nbsp;data down to no more than </span><span class="font11">10</span><span class="font12"> percent in any region, we proceeded with the analysis.</span></p><h4><a name="bookmark52"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Realize that data require a closer look</span></h4>
<p><span class="font12">During the final analysis of RTC records, which prompted a GAO investigation and ultimately led to a $40 billion reduction&nbsp;in one of the RTC’s funding requests, we discovered that the&nbsp;agency’s bookkeeping methods made it appear as though it were&nbsp;recouping substantially more of the bailout costs than was&nbsp;actually the case.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">To facilitate the sale of less desirable property, the agency had begun bundling one or more quality assets together with properties it could not give away under normal circumstances. While&nbsp;10 properties might collectively sell for $500,000, nine might be&nbsp;nearly worthless. The RTC would then put the $500,000 sale&nbsp;price on each of the individual properties included in the bundle&nbsp;without notation, making it look to the casual observer as though&nbsp;the total purchase price of the bundle was $5 million. Once we&nbsp;caught on to the bookkeeping shuffle, the agency’s performance&nbsp;looked far less rosy.</span></p><h4><a name="bookmark53"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Where possible, live with your data</span></h4>
<p><span class="font12">This is a luxury that few journalists can afford, particularly those at small newspapers or local television stations where they&nbsp;are asked to become experts in a day and allowed to focus on&nbsp;any one subject for a few days at most. Having said that, there is&nbsp;no substitute for getting to know every quirk in the data you&nbsp;have opted to analyze.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Upon deciding to leave the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Los Angeles Times</span><span class="font12"> to form our own consulting company in January 1996, my partner and I&nbsp;made a conscious decision to abandon temporarily any data-based work that did not in some way touch upon our expertise in&nbsp;covering campaigns. Having steeped ourselves in federal contribution data for six years, we knew we were in a unique position&nbsp;to spot trends others might not see.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The first such trend led our old employer to break a series of stories detailing the Democratic National Committee’s acceptance of foreign contributions and other questionable fundraising practices. It arose because we suddenly began seeing&nbsp;dozens of first-time soft money contributors and took the time to&nbsp;discover that at least one, Cheong Am America Inc., had no base&nbsp;of operations within the United States. While that first story was&nbsp;buried deep inside a Saturday edition, the series it spawned&nbsp;eventually won an IRE prize.</span></p><h4><a name="bookmark54"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Develop an analysis plan, even if you change it</span></h4>
<p><span class="font12">Every data analysis should begin with a story idea or hypothesis. Whenever possible, that hypothesis should grow from initial reporting. Only then should one look for data to sharpen the&nbsp;story’s focus - to prove or disprove the hypothesis in social science terms. Fishing expeditions are, in my experience, a complete&nbsp;waste of time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Do not assume you have been given the data you requested. While that sounds absurd, running a few simple checks on the&nbsp;data can save you the embarrassment of labeling your city the&nbsp;violent crime capital of the world when the database you are&nbsp;analyzing does not include Washington, D.C., and several other&nbsp;major metropolitan areas.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Develop rules for double checking information - including anything you enter into the database. With the RTC project we&nbsp;began by double checking the accuracy of any sale in which the&nbsp;assessed market value was either </span><span class="font11">10</span><span class="font12"> times greater or </span><span class="font11">10</span><span class="font12"> times&nbsp;smaller than the sale price. That simple rule led us to uncover the&nbsp;suspect bookkeeping procedures, which led us to check the&nbsp;validity of all data pertaining to bundled sales.</span></p><h4><a name="bookmark55"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Further education can be your friend</span></h4>
<p><span class="font12">Many editors will recognize the need for some form of technical training, but unfortunately most will interpret that to&nbsp;be an exercise in producing greater hardware and software&nbsp;proficiency. If your ultimate goal is to produce journalism that&nbsp;extends beyond the generation of ranked lists, you should seriously consider enrolling in a basic statistics course. If nothing&nbsp;else, it is important to know the difference between a mean, a&nbsp;median, and a mode and proper times to use each such measurement of the “average.” If data-based journalism is to take the&nbsp;next leap forward, it will be on the backs of reporters and editors&nbsp;who understand numbers.</span></p><h3><a name="bookmark56"></a><span class="font19">The Contraption</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">By Bob Port</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">I will never forget Elliot Jaspin with his clickity-clack tape drive contraption.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">It sat on a folding table in front of the classroom, a room filled with librarians, who aren’t easily impressed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The tape machine, no bigger than a suitcase, reminded me of the commercial reel-to-reel tape decks I’d seen as a boy in my&nbsp;uncle’s radio station, except that these tapes were the big ones.&nbsp;Government tapes, the size of a Frisbee. They were the tapes I’d&nbsp;seen as a boy on TV in episodes of </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Mystery Science Theater</span><span class="font12"> during cutaway scenes of Cold War missile control centers. You&nbsp;know the picture: Dozens of closet-sized tape cabinets with&nbsp;tapes jerking back and forth. Rows of lights flashing. Air Force&nbsp;generals, bathed in fluorescent light, pouring over massive printouts. The sound of high-pitched Morse code in the background.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The computer attached to Jaspin’s baby tape drive was a state-of-the-art portable in its day, which meant it cost a bundle. It had what seemed then to be a huge screen, but would only be a bit&nbsp;bigger than one of those personal information organizers you see&nbsp;young stock brokers sporting nowadays. It was a monochrome&nbsp;gas-plasma screen, an eerily glowing red affair that never did&nbsp;catch on because it practically needed a car battery to operate&nbsp;without a wall outlet. Its boxy size and shape reminded me of the&nbsp;Singer portable my mother had kept in her bedroom closet. The&nbsp;kind with a lid and leather handle on top - so heavy you’d never&nbsp;carry it farther than the kitchen table if you could avoid it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Click, click, click, click, click.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Jaspin’s tape reels rotated slowly and as they did, a little relay clicked on and off inside. As inches of magnetic tape moved&nbsp;across the heads, lines of data appeared on the screen. You could&nbsp;imagine the words flowing through the cable into the computer.&nbsp;Jaspin pecked at the keyboard: G-E-O-R-G-E S-T-E-I-N-B-R-E-N-N-E-R. He poked the Enter key like a piano player would&nbsp;finish with a high note. Click, click, click, click, click. Seconds&nbsp;later, a couple of rows of names, dates, and dollar amounts blurted across the screen. Then data stopped appearing for a while.&nbsp;Then it quickly filled the screen, spewing out pages of listings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Wow.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">There it was. Magic. The fantasy of an investigative reporter realized. Every federal campaign contribution made during the&nbsp;last decade by the owner of the New York Yankees, who was a&nbsp;shipbuilder and colorful local figure in Tampa Bay, where I lived&nbsp;then. All this was culled in less than a minute from more than a&nbsp;million records. On paper, I imagined, those records would fill a&nbsp;room. With Jaspin’s contraption, I could squirrel away those&nbsp;same records - or others - in a desk drawer. When I wanted, I&nbsp;could shuffle this stack of electronic index cards and uncover&nbsp;secrets that would make news.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">This, I thought, was powerful stuff and I had to have it. I was in love at first sight - in love with a damned computer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">That was in 1988.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Jaspin, a gray-haired Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative reporter from the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Providence Journal-Bulletin,</span><span class="font12"> was showing off</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">for a Poynter Institute seminar. I was a 30-something reporter at the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">St. Petersburg Times,</span><span class="font12"> looking for a new idea. This eureka&nbsp;moment changed the way I think about journalism forever.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">For years I had been proudly doing things, as most investigative reporters had, the old-fashioned way. I’d pour over court dockets and real estate records at dusty hallway tables, making&nbsp;lists on yellow legal pads. I’d built filing cabinets filled with&nbsp;obscure documents retrieved from microfilm in government&nbsp;offices. I’d compared little bits of information in one place with&nbsp;little bits in another - by eye and by hand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">I was a scientist, of sorts, I told myself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">What Jaspin (and a colleague, Dan Woods) had worked out wasn’t easy. However, in an age of computer automation, it was&nbsp;so, so overdue. Why shouldn’t reporters use computers to&nbsp;process records? It’s faster and better. Jaspin and Woods overcame the big obstacles: First, most government records were&nbsp;stored on tapes. Second, most computers that could read these&nbsp;tapes cost too much for journalists to acquire. They simply&nbsp;adapted the inexpensive personal computer, then a new invention, to read big old data tapes. It was a natural.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Suddenly, the impractical became possible. With it, new orders of magnitude in reporting became possible, too. Why&nbsp;bother looking at a few records or even a hundred records of&nbsp;something? Let’s just look at </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">every</span><span class="font12"> record of something. Why&nbsp;not start a fishing expedition? The fishing is so easy. Armed with&nbsp;a computer, the journalist became David. The computer became&nbsp;a slingshot. Any subject was Goliath.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Computer assisted reporting, Jaspin’s name for his new system, became a craze for journalists. Many adopted it with a&nbsp;kind of religious zeal. Standard procedure was to locate a nerd&nbsp;hiding within the newsroom, usually someone who had used&nbsp;pocket protectors and slide rules in high school. He would be&nbsp;confined to an untrammeled comer of the newsroom where the&nbsp;electromagnetic radiation could be contained and, </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">voila,</span><span class="font12"> impressive findings would emanate. If someone needed computer&nbsp;assisted reporting, he or she had only to seek out the CAR guru&nbsp;and obtain a blessing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Despite its mystery, there was no mistaking that stories built on computer assisted reporting had impact. CAR was answering&nbsp;big questions. It began to win many Pulitzer Prizes. Supported&nbsp;by an editor with a passion for investigative projects, I embraced&nbsp;this culture wholeheartedly:</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">■ While investigating labor corruption among longshoremen, I used spreadsheets to build rosters of pensioners - taking bits of</span></p><div><img src="when-nerds-and-words-collide_files/when-nerds-and-words-collide-21.jpg" style="width:51pt;height:83pt;"/>
<p><span class="font2">Bob Port is special assignment editor for The Associated Press in New York. He heads a team&nbsp;of AP national writers who do investigative reporting, often using computer assisted reporting&nbsp;techniques. Before joining the AP in 1995, Port&nbsp;worked 12 years at the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">St. Petersburg Times,&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">where he worked on special projects and&nbsp;introduced the newspaper to computer assisted&nbsp;reporting.</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">37</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
<p><span class="font12">sketchy information from here and there and using each bit to leverage more details and to pin down more names and dates.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I used different gaps in different computer data left by the&nbsp;sealing of court cases to reconstruct facts about sealed cases and&nbsp;zero in on abuses in the act of sealing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I compared data tapes of teachers against data tapes of&nbsp;criminals. Data tapes of cops against data tapes of gun dealers.&nbsp;Data tapes of wrecked cars against data tapes of used cars&nbsp;re-sold but not-so-well rebuilt.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I looked at dispatch logs of not a few, but all emergency&nbsp;calls across many years to find where weaknesses lay.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wheeled a PC and tape drive into the governor’s office,&nbsp;demanding to make a copy of the state payroll when officials&nbsp;had foot-dragged, to prove that the governor was really adding&nbsp;employees, not cutting them, as he’d claimed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">My little stories made a difference. A union president was indicted. Judges were investigated. Laws were amended.&nbsp;Dangerous teachers were getting fired. Gun control was toughened. Car dealers were made more honest. A rural 911 system&nbsp;was created. The governor was forced to set the record straight&nbsp;on spending. I left my old job for a bigger one at The Associated&nbsp;Press.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">At the same time that computer assisted reporting was becoming mainstream, a parallel revolution in investigative&nbsp;journalism was happening - one that confuses many editors and&nbsp;publishers because it seems to be part of the same thing: online&nbsp;research. It was exploding in its usefulness and power. Meanwhile, its relative cost was plummeting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">This sea change began among quieter newsmen and news-women, news librarians.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The same digital automation that Elliot Jaspin had adapted to reviewing government records was being used to automate the&nbsp;newsroom morgue, cutting hours off a mindless chore every&nbsp;reporter and editor faced daily: looking up what was published&nbsp;last week or last year. As more publications did it, an economy&nbsp;grew out of everyone using everyone else’s electronic morgue.&nbsp;The tools for this kind of research, the personal computer and a&nbsp;modem to connect to other computers, opened up an infinity of&nbsp;sources for the journalist.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">It made sense for these tools to evolve in the news library. Librarians are educated to appreciate the issues of electronic research. They’re quicker to grasp its significance. Journalists&nbsp;are reluctant to admit a computer can out-report them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">I am continually amazed at how much I can learn quickly from online research and the exponential rate of innovation it is&nbsp;enjoying:</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Litigation. </span><span class="font12">In just the last year, it has become possible to do a search of all federal court cases by a litigant’s name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Business records. </span><span class="font12">Dun &amp; Bradstreet has taken its intelligence files on companies and loaded them into a relational database.&nbsp;The Securities and Exchange Commission is essentially all electronic now. Corporate records are easier than ever to search.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Finding people. </span><span class="font12">The choices for locating and identifying people are ballooning. I use Phone Disk, a CD-ROM product that basically re-creates every phone book in America, searchable&nbsp;every which way - and my whole organization uses it&nbsp;routinely. Professional directories are going electronic, one by</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">one. AutoTrack, CDB Infotek, and other detective databases are becoming frighteningly more comprehensive and cheap.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Government data. </span><span class="font12">The revised federal Freedom of Information Act of last year is forcing agencies to design new computers with public access in mind. Much of what used to be a struggle to&nbsp;get is readily available online.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">I used to hear editors and publishers say: “Reporters don’t need a personal computer.” A reporter’s computer was a word&nbsp;processor - a typewriter with a TV screen. Now, I don’t know of&nbsp;a newsroom in America that isn’t scrambling to cram all manner&nbsp;of new gizmos into its next capital budget. Computer assisted&nbsp;reporting and online research aren’t experimental in journalism&nbsp;anymore. They’re essential. They’ve been adopted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">And the biggest change in the decade since Elliot Jaspin began showing off his tape contraption is a monster: the Internet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Forget about magnetic tapes and modems - at least, in the long run. When I watch my 4-year-old nephew click his way&nbsp;around the World Wide Web, I am both astounded and terrified&nbsp;at the future of journalism and mass communications. Clearly, in&nbsp;the future, everything in the information world will be a website.&nbsp;Anyone who’s anybody will have a website, and use websites,&nbsp;or be nobody and nowhere.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The Internet is really just a set of rules - rules for any computer to talk through telephone lines to any other computer. But these rules work. They’ve caught on, and with an unstoppable&nbsp;momentum. They’ve reached critical mass.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">“Computer assisted reporting,” as the idea was first envisioned, barely begins to encompass what we, as journalists, will have to&nbsp;confront in the world of technology if we are to preserve the&nbsp;profession’s higher callings. Computers are becoming information appliances and are destined to be as ubiquitous as toasters.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Given where we are, and where we’ve come from, I think that reporters who have styled themselves as users of computer&nbsp;assisted reporting need to grapple with several issues:</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Get a name. </span><span class="font12">We need a better name and a definition for this&nbsp;intersection of reporter and computer. Words matter. “Computer&nbsp;assisted reporting” doesn’t make sense as a name for what many&nbsp;of us do. The novelty implied by it will never last. As a former&nbsp;colleague, Bill Dedman, once noted in an article in the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Columbia Journalism Review,</span><span class="font12"> it’s like talking about something called&nbsp;“telephone assisted reporting.” Of course, we use telephones&nbsp;and, of course, we use computers to report the news.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">It’s too much of a “duh” name. How do we differentiate “CAR” from online research? I’d argue there’s no difference.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Make new divisions of labor. </span><span class="font12">I don’t see any way that a&nbsp;journalist, a writer and assessor of facts, could possibly stay on&nbsp;top of the changing world of technology and continue to do his&nbsp;or her job. Technology is just too complicated. The tradition for&nbsp;the journalist is to function as a lone wolf, getting all the facts&nbsp;and writing the story. However, just as an on-camera TV reporter has a producer and crew behind him or her, we need a&nbsp;workable role for technology experts to back up the reporter.&nbsp;What do we call them?</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">We also need to resolve how one of the standard institutions of the news operation, the library, fits into a newer structure. It&nbsp;ought to be actively involved in the newsgathering process.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Admit that data can be journalism. </span><span class="font12">It won’t happen</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">38</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">k</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
<p><span class="font12">overnight, but the direction of things is obvious. Computer data in its almost raw form is becoming the stuff of journalism. It was&nbsp;never practical to print, in a broadsheet, the whole Pentagon&nbsp;budget.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">However, it is rapidly becoming practical to publish it on the Internet in a value-added form that would have utility for news&nbsp;consumers. I’d like to see journalists, not bureaucrats, do this&nbsp;and decide when it’s worth doing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Trouble is, we lack definitions for how this is done well. Some early efforts have stumbled. Meanwhile, few news organizations hesitated to publish the entire Kenneth Starr investigation on their Internet sites.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Where do we draw the line between source material for the journalist and material that is, in its entirety, worth passing&nbsp;along?</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">■ Accept statistics. </span><span class="font12">Computers, by their nature, invite the journalist to assess the bigger picture - the incidence, the prevalence, the significance, or the bias of things taken together.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Journalists are notoriously poor at math. If they even endured a mathematics course in college, they likely avoided any</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">exposure to the science of statistics. This is ironic because statistics empower the scientist to be objective in measuring&nbsp;complicated, subtle phenomena. We ought to be better social&nbsp;scientists and force ourselves to learn statistics or hire journalists&nbsp;who already know the subject. Try to do a story about redlining&nbsp;without statistical analysis.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">■ Establish ethical guidelines. </span><span class="font12">We are in danger of losing our claim to digital information if we abuse it. The public and&nbsp;the courts are suspicious of journalists armed with computers.&nbsp;We need a more mature ethical code for handling computer data&nbsp;and respecting personal privacy in its use. We ought to rate&nbsp;commercial services and boycott them when they violate our&nbsp;profession’s code. We ought to distance ourselves from private&nbsp;investigators and mass marketers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">We need this to maintain our only real asset, trust.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">I’m hopeful about the future for computer assisted reporting, whatever we decide to call it, and I’m very envious of my&nbsp;nephew’s future on the web.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">I’m also not about to get rid of my magnetic tape drive - yet -clickity-clack as it is.</span></p><div>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">By Pedro Enrique Armendares</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Periodistas de Investigation</span><span class="font12"> (PI) began its activities in 1996, as a project of Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) that&nbsp;was made possible by a grant from the Robert M. McCormick&nbsp;Tribune Foundation. The idea, presented by IRE members from&nbsp;Mexico and the United States, was to establish a training program in Mexico similar to the one IRE has developed in the&nbsp;United States and elsewhere for more than 20 years. The program would include workshops on computer assisted reporting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">In September of that year, Lise Olsen and I opened the new office in the country’s capital. Lise came with many years of&nbsp;experience in investigative journalism for various media in the&nbsp;United States, and with a history of activism as an IRE member&nbsp;and a teacher. I began my work in radio and television, and then&nbsp;went on to cover special assignments for seven years at the&nbsp;Mexico City daily </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">La Jornada.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The timing couldn’t have been better. In the last decade, Mexico has undergone immense changes, and the country is still&nbsp;going through a yet-uncertain political transition. The economic&nbsp;reforms undertaken by the last three administrations have been&nbsp;accompanied by constant electoral dispute, the rise of left- and&nbsp;right-leaning opposition that threatens the dominance of the&nbsp;governing Revolutionary Institutional Party (PRI), political&nbsp;assassinations, and the appearance of peasant guerrilla movements in the southern part of the country. This process has been&nbsp;closely followed by an increasingly conscious and participatory&nbsp;society that, above all, is much more ready to demand accountability from politicians.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The media’s situation is also very different from that of a few years ago. Mexico has always had a large number of dailies - in&nbsp;the capital alone there are more than </span><span class="font11">20</span><span class="font12"> - but quality journalism&nbsp;has always faced an uphill battle against the twin devils of payoffs and censorship. The same government that could be more&nbsp;than generous to friendly media could also become a mortal&nbsp;enemy to a newspaper that ran “uncomfortable” stories.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Although the government continues to exercise inappropriate influence on the media, many of the latter are progressively&nbsp;more dependent on public preference and advertisers than on&nbsp;official subsidies. Government censorship, meanwhile, has been&nbsp;reduced to a level that surprises the most skeptical of Mexicans.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">All this is beneficial to investigative journalism, which although not new in Mexico, has not developed to the level&nbsp;required by an increasingly sophisticated and demanding public.&nbsp;This is especially true for CAR, which very few Mexican&nbsp;reporters use.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">When we first offered our workshops on investigative journalism and CAR, the response was quite good and we encountered our first surprise: In spite of the marked centralism that besets Mexico, the interest in our project was much greater in cities other than the capital. Moreover, we also started to field queries&nbsp;and requests for workshops from media in other countries in the</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">For the ideas provided especially for this essay, I would like to thank Alma Delia Fuentes, information and training coordinator at </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Periodistas de Investigacion,</span><span class="font2"> and&nbsp;ideas provided by Lise Olsen during her tenure as director (1996-1998).</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">region, including Colombia, Argentina, Brazil, and Peru. The PI project soon went continental, and we have conducted workshops or taken part in conferences and seminars throughout&nbsp;Latin America.</span></p><h4><a name="bookmark58"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Both interest and skepticism</span></h4>
<p><span class="font12">Our initial CAR workshops in newsrooms in Mexico and other Latin American countries generally provoked a curious&nbsp;mixture of skepticism and interest. Although our colleagues&nbsp;recognized the importance of investigative journalism and many&nbsp;practiced it with impressive results, relatively few had used&nbsp;CAR tools such as the Internet, spreadsheets, and database&nbsp;managers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Moreover, when we showed examples of computer assisted stories done in the United States, our new friends reacted with a&nbsp;sort of computer envy. They thought the stories were excellent&nbsp;reporting, but they also brought up all sorts of reasons to explain&nbsp;why this type of journalism couldn’t be done in Latin America.&nbsp;Some thought electronic information was not available or that&nbsp;official statistics were not reliable in our countries, while others&nbsp;argued that few reporters have modem computers and access to&nbsp;the Internet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">What all agreed upon - and it is indeed a major problem - is that in the traditional political culture that persists in Latin&nbsp;American countries, bureaucrats and politicians tend to consider&nbsp;public information as a personal resource and assume the right&nbsp;to share it or not with the press and the public.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">This problem is particularly serious in countries such as Mexico, where freedom of information legislation is ambiguous&nbsp;and toothless, and in countries with a recent authoritarian past in&nbsp;which journalistic investigation is still stifled by “national security” constraints.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">In the past few years, however, we have confirmed that CAR is not only possible in Latin America but that its use contributes&nbsp;to weakening the official monopoly on information. For&nbsp;example, reporters can use the Internet to find information&nbsp;through alternative sources that bureaucrats and politicians try&nbsp;to hide. Then they can analyze this information using spreadsheets or database managers, and compare it with official news&nbsp;releases. Once the reporting is published, those politicians are&nbsp;forced to respond, and on occasion this results in the release of&nbsp;information that was previously controlled. This is not an automatic, or even a frequent, process, but it does happen.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Latin American reporters also are finding that some types of official information actually are available, including socio-demo-</span></p><div><img src="when-nerds-and-words-collide_files/when-nerds-and-words-collide-22.jpg" style="width:67pt;height:85pt;"/>
<p><span class="font2">Pedro Enrique Armendares is the director of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Periodistas de Investigacion,</span><span class="font2"> IRE's branch in&nbsp;Mexico City. Before that, he was a special&nbsp;assignments reporter for the Mexico City daily&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">La Jornada,</span><span class="font2"> a position he held for seven years.&nbsp;He has experience in film and television and&nbsp;has worked as a correspondent for the Latin&nbsp;American Service of the BBC and other international radio networks.</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
<p><span class="font12">graphic census data, health statistics, and electoral data. Such information is not only trustworthy; it holds a vast potential.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">It has also been interesting to note how many Latin American government offices, perhaps because their directors want to feel&nbsp;so very modem, have extensive websites. Ironically, much&nbsp;information can be quickly found at these sites that would take&nbsp;days or weeks to find in a traditional press office, given the poor&nbsp;organization or intentional procrastination of the bureaucrats&nbsp;involved.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Last but not least, Latin American reporters also make more frequent use of information from the private sector, including&nbsp;financial and economic data. In this area it is common for&nbsp;information managers to be more willing to share documents&nbsp;that are often available in electronic form and ready for analysis.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Another advantage for Latin American CAR is that many governmental offices and private firms skipped the era of mainframe computers and work mostly with PCs. Therefore, Latin&nbsp;American reporters can usually obtain information in a more&nbsp;accessible format compared with their U.S. colleagues, who&nbsp;struggle with older and clumsier machines.</span></p><h4><a name="bookmark59"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Some examples, some results</span></h4>
<p><span class="font12">Our CAR workshops are usually quite interactive, and many colleagues who take them immediately began to apply the&nbsp;techniques learned. For example, during a Microsoft Access&nbsp;workshop in Brazil, we used a U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service database of legal immigrants to the United States; a&nbsp;few days later one of the reporters ran a front-page story on the&nbsp;“brain drain” of Brazilian executives to the United States, lured&nbsp;by attractive professional offers. It’s true that he was no&nbsp;newcomer to CAR, but we have seen many colleagues with no&nbsp;former training start working on story ideas or at least build a&nbsp;personal database even before the workshop is over.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Some Latin American colleagues are doing very interesting things with their own databases, built from information from&nbsp;paper documents. For example, reporters from the daily&nbsp;</span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Publico,</span><span class="font12"> in Guadalajara, Mexico, and </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">El Universal,</span><span class="font12"> in Caracas,&nbsp;Venezuela, have done interesting articles on the profile and&nbsp;background of felons convicted for drug-related offenses. In&nbsp;both cases they got the information from judicial sources - in&nbsp;Venezuela it was relatively easy, while in Mexico it was like&nbsp;pulling teeth - to later design their database, enter the data, and&nbsp;analyze it using Access.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Publico</span><span class="font12">’s series was particularly interesting. It showed that only 5 percent of the arrests had been the result of police investigations. The rest resulted after random inspections, tip-offs, or&nbsp;even accidents in which vehicles carrying drugs were involved.&nbsp;These stories also detected glaring inconsistencies in sentencing&nbsp;patterns. For example, a kid caught at home with two dope&nbsp;plants is serving the same jail time as a recurrent smuggler who&nbsp;was captured while transporting dozens of pounds of cocaine.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Latin American reporters also are taking advantage of those fields in which access to information is improving, including&nbsp;official information in digital format. CAR has allowed Jose&nbsp;Roberto Toledo, of </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Folha de Sao Paulo</span><span class="font12"> in Brazil, to use statistical information produced by government offices to portray the&nbsp;darker sides of his society. Last year, for example, he used data</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">from the Ministry of Health to inform readers that homicide is the first cause of death among children between </span><span class="font11">10</span><span class="font12"> and 14 years&nbsp;of age in Sao Paulo, and that in many cases the killers are their&nbsp;own parents.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Another fertile area is electoral coverage. In all the countries we have visited we have found a treasure trove of electoral data,&nbsp;compiled by the government or private organizations, which can&nbsp;often be accessed on the Internet. Mexico provides a dramatic&nbsp;example: In the controversial 1988 elections, the results from&nbsp;some polling stations had not arrived in Mexico City one week&nbsp;after the election. In 1994 the now-independent electoral&nbsp;authorities began to deliver the results in the afternoon of&nbsp;election day to several Internet sites, and by dawn Mexican and&nbsp;foreign reporters were analyzing, charting, and mapping the&nbsp;final (albeit unofficial) tally.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">There is a rich vein of information about campaign finances and the relationship between elected officials and private&nbsp;interests that Latin American reporters have not yet fully&nbsp;explored, perhaps because related laws are new in many&nbsp;countries. Information is not as abundant as in the United States,&nbsp;but once again some papers such as </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">El Universal</span><span class="font12"> offer in their&nbsp;websites extensive data in databases created by the paper’s staff.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Latin American reporters also are finding new ways to bypass the hurdles to information in their<sup>-</sup> own countries by using&nbsp;foreign sources. Here the Internet is particularly useful, since it&nbsp;can be used to identify and reach international sources - scholars, journalists, and even government sites - that have relevant&nbsp;information for Latin American countries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Gerardo Reyes, Internet enthusiast, friend, and </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Miami Herald </span><span class="font12">reporter, provides a telling anecdote. He was teaching an Internet workshop to a group of Central American journalists, and&nbsp;while he was using the General Accounting Office’s site as an&nbsp;example, a Honduran editor literally jumped out of his chair.&nbsp;Reyes had run into extensive data on U.S. military aid to the&nbsp;Honduran military. The editor ran to the phone to convey this&nbsp;information to his colleagues. The information, he explained, is&nbsp;“classified for national security reasons” in his own country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The end of the Cold War has also played a role. In Mexico, Claudia Fernandez discovered that the U.S. government was&nbsp;declassifying a large number of documents from the KGB. One&nbsp;should recall that during the Cold War, Mexico City was an&nbsp;important espionage center, a sort of Latin America Vienna.&nbsp;Fernandez used the National Security Archives web page to&nbsp;obtain information sent to Moscow by the Soviet embassy in the&nbsp;1940s and ’50s. She used this information to do a four-part&nbsp;series on Soviet espionage in Mexico, and she described the&nbsp;activities, code names, and even identities of Mexican spies,&nbsp;including artists, writers, and ordinary citizens.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">In the business and economic beat, Francisco Vidal navigates for hours each week to find ideas, tips, and hard data to support&nbsp;his reporting. For example, when researching the numerous&nbsp;mergers between large Mexican and multinational firms, he was&nbsp;stonewalled by most executives. On the Internet, however, he&nbsp;has been able to find much of the necessary information, either&nbsp;at the sites of the financial firms that deal with this type of transaction or, ironically, at the pages of some of the very firms that&nbsp;wouldn’t provide information through more traditional channels.</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">41</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
<p><span class="font12">If his information allows it, Vidal uses Excel or Access to analyze and complete his reporting.</span></p><h4><a name="bookmark60"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">A few problems</span></h4>
<p><span class="font12">A real problem that we have found is that in many newsrooms, when owners or managers make an effort to acquire modem equipment, reporters often resist the necessary training&nbsp;either due to fear of technology or because they think their time&nbsp;is too “valuable” to squander in computing lessons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">We have seen too many newsrooms in which modem computers are reduced to glorified word processors, while the&nbsp;reporter doesn’t suspect the hidden resources that might be&nbsp;found in that unopened Microsoft Office folder. They find it&nbsp;easier to get help at their paper’s library or information center, if&nbsp;it has one, or to base their stories solely on readily available&nbsp;documents such as official press releases.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">At the same time, most media show little interest in investing in training for their reporters in CAR techniques. Their leitmotif&nbsp;is the recurring economic crisis, while in reality many of the&nbsp;owners and publishers in the region are still not convinced of the&nbsp;profitability of CAR and other modem journalistic resources.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">There are, however, some impressive cases, such as </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Folha cle Sao Paulo,</span><span class="font12"> which sponsors an extraordinary training program&nbsp;both for its staff and for young men and women fresh out of&nbsp;journalism school and other fields.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">There are also absurd situations, as when a daily from northern Mexico hired us to conduct an Internet workshop for its&nbsp;newsroom. After two days of demonstrating search methods,&nbsp;useful sites, and reporting techniques, we asked the class members to talk about how they used the web. “We don’t,” they&nbsp;answered. “Our management decided that it’s a waste of time&nbsp;and money and suspended all our accounts.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">We have encountered other pitfalls. For example, some colleagues have shown such enthusiasm about information&nbsp;obtained on the Internet or the hard data they run through&nbsp;spreadsheets or database managers that they seem to forego</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">traditional reporting, that is, the need to turn that information into an interesting story. We often read stories that are nothing&nbsp;more than a few dry paragraphs surrounded by tables and&nbsp;graphics, or failed stories that run out of steam three lines after&nbsp;the lead.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">This, we are sure, is something that will progressively disappear as the novelty of these techniques wears off among reporters and the public, and especially when data-dazzled&nbsp;editors pick up their pencils and start doing their jobs again.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Another related problem, which might be more troublesome because it can misinform readers, is that some colleagues who&nbsp;discover CAR don’t have a proper knowledge of the field they&nbsp;cover or even basic statistical training.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The increasing “friendliness” of Excel and Access, for example, can lead them to manipulate data incorrectly and reach unwarranted or even wrong conclusions that might then be printed as news.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">We trust that these and other problems will be the exception as Latin American journalism develops more savvy reporters and,&nbsp;of course, readers. Also helpful in this process will be the&nbsp;expanding network of CAR pioneers who, as they refine their&nbsp;methodologies and broaden their knowledge, can share them&nbsp;with colleagues who have just arrived on the scene. This has&nbsp;happened in countries such as the United States with the collaboration of IRE and NICAR.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Lastly, it is common in this part of the world, as elsewhere, for many newly graduated journalists to dream of becoming the latest&nbsp;stars of investigative journalism. And, as elsewhere, vacancies&nbsp;are scarce.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">But if more young journalists acquire and apply CAR skills to their daily reporting, the quality of Latin American journalism in&nbsp;general will improve, and perhaps we’ll finally overcome that&nbsp;old debate about whether investigative journalism is a specialty&nbsp;in itself or if, as Gabriel Garcia Marquez insists, it is a redundant&nbsp;expression.</span></p><div>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">By Nils Mulvad</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Introducing CAR raises a lot of opportunities for journalists to concentrate on education, computer adminstration, meetings,&nbsp;conferences, writing books, and so on. But getting stories in the&nbsp;paper will be the best proof of the technique. The bottom line is&nbsp;that stories count, and somebody has to write them. So you’d&nbsp;better learn to be good at that.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">That’s the main lesson.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Reporters in Denmark - the small country with 5.2 million inhabitants - are some years behind American journalists in&nbsp;their use of CAR.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">From the outset, there was a rather defeatist attitude toward CAR in Denmark. Common thinking was that if we did the&nbsp;same land of stories that were done in the United States, we&nbsp;would be put in jail. But in the last three years this has changed&nbsp;fundamentally.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Like the authorities of other Scandinavian countries, the Danish authorities have made much use of computers, but access to electronic information has been very restrictive. There generally&nbsp;is no legal basis for gaining access to electronic information.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">On the other hand, the Danish population since 1970 has had some possibility of access to paper documents, and slowly a&nbsp;practice of fighting for this access has developed. Over the&nbsp;years, one professor at the Danish School of Journalism (DJH),&nbsp;Mr. Knud Aage Froebert, especially has helped journalists gain&nbsp;access.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Although no right of access to electronic data exists, many authorities are prepared to pass on information anyway. Moreover, other laws can be used to formulate precise requests for an&nbsp;alteration of the existing rules.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">CAR requires persistence. My </span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Jyllands-Posten</span><span class="font12"> colleague Flemming Svith and I learned this from a course and a trip&nbsp;around the United States in 1996. In retrospect, the strategy of&nbsp;introducing CAR in Denmark has consisted of a number of elements:</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Using theoretical and legal reports that present the request&nbsp;to access electronic documents.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Persuading individual authorities to experiment with different kinds of electronic access.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Making the trade union, the publishers’ association, and&nbsp;DJH agree and compromise concerning the requests of the&nbsp;press; involving all parties in the work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Educating ourselves about CAR and developing our technique.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Getting international CAR contacts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Writing good articles based on computer assisted reporting,&nbsp;proving in practice that CAR results in better journalism. (This&nbsp;is perhaps the most important element.).</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Establishing an association and network of contacts for&nbsp;journalists who wish to start working with CAR.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Training journalists and establishing a CAR institute.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">All the elements have played an extremely important role in progress in Denmark. And we have been lucky. In the begin</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">ning, only a few people were active. Now a very important mix of people are active. Reporters in different fields of expertise&nbsp;have been able to cooperate. And from the outset, a very experienced FOI lawyer has joined the effort and used his reputation to&nbsp;make the field important. Moreover, there has been support&nbsp;from DJH management, the trade union, and the publishers’ association.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Naturally, there have been lots of problems and difficult decisions. Sometimes we have made the wrong choices and&nbsp;evaluations, but help and debate have made us able to move in&nbsp;the right direction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">One of the most important decisions was made in April 1998. Before that, the Association of Computer Assisted Reporting in&nbsp;Denmark had been founded, the first Danish CAR day had been&nbsp;launched, authorities’ experiments were in progress, etc. The&nbsp;first courses had been run and the first articles had been written.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Consequently, we decided to establish DICAR - the Danish Institute for Computer Assisted Reporting. Based on experiences from Sweden and the United States, we realized that a&nbsp;more formal and ambitious structure of CAR training and&nbsp;communication of experience was needed. The institute was&nbsp;based on three important principles:</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would be non-profit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The association, i.e. the active journalists, would be in&nbsp;control.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quick action in the beginning in order to secure a stable and&nbsp;democratic system later on.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">And it has worked. We are putting the finishing touches to the statutes and a cooperation agreement with DJH. We have run the&nbsp;first courses, we have a home page on the Internet, we organize&nbsp;conferences, we are beginning to receive money, and we have so&nbsp;much work to do that the institute needs a part-time employee.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Then comes the difficult part - to write good articles based on CAR in an environment that does not include the same kind of&nbsp;open access to data as in the United States. That gave us a lot of&nbsp;problems. The first articles were not very good. But they were&nbsp;there. Our aim was to learn to master the technique by means of&nbsp;small articles and small sets of data.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The approach backfired. Many members of </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Jyllands-Posten</span><span class="font12">'s editorial staff began to question the value of CAR. At one point&nbsp;we were forced to change our strategy. We had to delay and&nbsp;change the priority of the other tasks to make a serious effort to&nbsp;write good articles. Begining in the summer of 1997, participation in seminars, meetings with authorities, and the training of</span></p><div><img src="when-nerds-and-words-collide_files/when-nerds-and-words-collide-23.jpg" style="width:62pt;height:84pt;"/>
<p><span class="font2">Nils Mulvad is a reporter with </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Morgenavisen Jyllands-Posten,</span><span class="font2"> Denmark's largest newspaper.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">He has worked for </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Computerworld</span><span class="font2"> in Denmark and teaches computer assisted reporting at the&nbsp;Danish School of Journalism. He is one of the&nbsp;co-founders of the Association of Computer&nbsp;Assisted Reporting in Denmark (founded in 1997).</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">43</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
<p><span class="font12">colleagues were put on the back burner. Instead, we worked intensively on articles to prove the value of CAR. That has&nbsp;resulted in a number of good articles, and over time electronic&nbsp;data have been created - data that have been used in other news&nbsp;articles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Svith and I also have had the opportunity to write a CAR textbook based on the experience in Denmark.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Where do we go from here? Here are my immediate concerns and personal views.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most important is making the association and the institute&nbsp;run stably now that they have been established - very much like&nbsp;IRE/NICAR in the United States. The Danish institute is still&nbsp;weak, and it will take a special effort to make it stronger.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the institute’s (and Danish CAR journalists’) major&nbsp;tasks will be to get an overview of all the material Danish&nbsp;authorities place on the Internet these days. There is a flood of&nbsp;data that need to be structured and compared with other data and&nbsp;journalistic leads.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Continue the dialogue with the authorities concerning&nbsp;specific experiments with mailing lists and access to electronic&nbsp;documents, and the broader and more fundamental issue of&nbsp;formulating proposals for law reform.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consider CAR in connection with Internet publication and&nbsp;intranets - already very much an issue in the United States.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consider how the CAR method should function in connection with other computer assisted tools such as group work and&nbsp;mobile work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is still (and this is very important) necessary to work to&nbsp;generate more really good articles based on CAR. Perhaps in a&nbsp;few years when there will be a considerable number of active&nbsp;CAR journalists, it would be a good idea to institute a special&nbsp;prize for this type of journalism.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CAR should be made an integrated part of the training at all&nbsp;three schools of journalism in Denmark.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Looking further ahead, I see the following tasks for CAR:</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Basically, the aim is to secure democracy in the society of&nbsp;the future. Computers enable the authorities to exercise expert</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">power to an even greater extent without the citizens and the media being able to exercise control. We must do whatever we&nbsp;can to eliminate this imbalance. One of the key issues will be to&nbsp;secure the public’s right to be informed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should probably also consider how to make CAR an&nbsp;established part of our profession. That would specifically&nbsp;require more contact with other associations and more joint activities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should work to create a special set of CAR ethics. If the&nbsp;aim is better journalism and monitoring authorities, it will take a&nbsp;different kind of credibility with the public than journalism normally enjoys. We can set a high standard from the beginning. In&nbsp;any case, the performance of CAR demands that more attention&nbsp;be paid to ethics than is the case with traditional journalism.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Denmark there is very limited research within the field&nbsp;of journalism, and journalists tend not to read books and have a&nbsp;theoretical approach to their profession. If, in the longer term,&nbsp;DICAR can be instrumental in carrying out proper research and&nbsp;strengthening the theoretical aspect of the profession, I can only&nbsp;support it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;International cooperation is another issue. CAR has already&nbsp;brought about international contacts, especially to American and&nbsp;Swedish journalists, and some contact between Danish CAR&nbsp;journalists. This trend will surely continue. At </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Jyllands-Posten&nbsp;</span><span class="font12">we tried to find out whether an international project would be&nbsp;possible. Nothing came out of it, but it would be an excellent&nbsp;project once the routine is better integrated in Denmark.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last, but not least, there is the issue of international cooperation concerning law and rules. In this field, the whole Internet&nbsp;regulation and the European Union (EU) directive on personal&nbsp;data will make cooperation necessary. We have tried on a very&nbsp;small scale, but so far the effort has had no practical significance. I believe that this could quickly appear on the agenda,&nbsp;and then we must have a good and appropriate framework within which to tackle it. I have not yet quite figured out how this&nbsp;will be achieved.</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">44</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><h3><a name="bookmark62"></a><span class="font19">On the Road to Digital Journalism</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">By Peter J. Verwey</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">I remember very well the technology that was used the first time I entered a newsroom. Newspapers were still situated in the&nbsp;center of the city, and the editor in chief wrote the editorial with&nbsp;his fountain pen. It was by accident that I entered the newsroom&nbsp;of that local newspaper, </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">De Gelderlander,</span><span class="font12"> in the city of&nbsp;Nijmegen. As a student, in need of money, I was employed on a&nbsp;temporary basis as a proofreader. The technology was of childish simplicity; as proofreader, I used a red pencil. It wasn’t much&nbsp;better in the newsroom. The ultimate technology was the&nbsp;message system of wind-mail, an ancient forerunner of e-mail&nbsp;based on ah<sup>-</sup> pressure that made it possible to send a message&nbsp;through pipelines from newsroom to printshop.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">When I now enter newsrooms, not only of the national newspapers but also the remotest regional and local newspapers,&nbsp;they are filled with high information technology: computers,&nbsp;networks, Internet and intranets, and the most advanced software.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The first thing one can conclude from this development is that the demands on journalists have became much greater in recent&nbsp;years. Of course the old techniques and skills are still important&nbsp;and very useful. Every journalist must always possess some&nbsp;curiosity, know how to tell a story, and so on. But journalists&nbsp;now also need to know how to handle modem information technology. “Hard-nosed reporting, cultivation of sources, and public records searches may have once amounted to sufficient journalistic skills. But today, in the face of a rapidly growing Internet, journalists need training in new media” says Neda Raouf in&nbsp;“Cross-training Journalists,” </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Online Journalism Review</span><span class="font12">, Nov.&nbsp;11,1998.'</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Skills in these media range from simple word-processing, handling digital images, and editing on screen, to retrieving the&nbsp;latest unemployment figures from the Internet, and calculating&nbsp;key figures about unemployment in spreadsheets. These new&nbsp;demands on journalists are not only in searching for news. The&nbsp;digital revolution also has influenced publishing; the Internet is&nbsp;sometimes called the “fourth medium.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Therefore journalists must also know how to handle text on the Internet: the basics of html are as important as copy markup&nbsp;language for letterpress printing. Writing has evolved from a&nbsp;linear process to a multi-dimensional one. And interactivity,&nbsp;two-way communication with readers, is an important characteristic.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The fourth medium, however, is more than shovelware; it integrates sound and video. Newspaper journalists have no&nbsp;experience with these techniques, and TV journalists have little&nbsp;experience writing articles. “We learned a lot, but still we have a&nbsp;long way to go,” says Theo Stielstra, editor in chief of </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">de Volk-skrant online.</span><span class="font12"> “Our online edition is still close to the hardcopy&nbsp;edition, and the number of journalists who use sources on the&nbsp;Internet is limited; this will change in the coming months when&nbsp;the complete newsroom is online.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Wp://www.ojr.org/indexf,htm?/sections/features/98_stories/stories_training.htm</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">As an educator, my first question is: How do we prepare students for this new situation? They are the workers of tomorrow, so they must be trained in latest skills. They must know the&nbsp;state of the art in detail.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">My second question is: How do you train journalists so they can work with this new technology?</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Finally: In what context will journalists be working? What changes in communications could take place?</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">In 1989 I was teaching several international classes about politics of European Union (EU) and European reporting. My&nbsp;search for the latest press releases of the European Commission&nbsp;brought me by coincidence to the Internet. One of the data&nbsp;networks I accessed to the press database of the EU offered a&nbsp;gateway to the Internet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">I was very pleased to discover that I could send mail and files to persons at the other side of the pond. Of course, the CompuServe I used at the time was more user-friendly, but this Internet&nbsp;connection had new, unexpected possibilities. My Dutch colleagues were impressed when I told them how I got the latest information about the U.S. Social Security system. I left a message at the CARR-L discussion list, and within the hour received&nbsp;the address of the Gopher of the SSA.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Still, my colleagues were not seduced by the new technology. “Too difficult for day-to-day practice,” they said. After graphic&nbsp;Internet browsers were introduced in 1993, they changed their&nbsp;opinions. Now they are all on the grid and use it for lectures and&nbsp;training.</span></p><h4><a name="bookmark63"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Education of journalism students</span></h4>
<p><span class="font12">The situation on the European continent differs from the Anglo-Saxon ways of journalism education. In the Netherlands, journalism is not taught at universities but in professional&nbsp;schools. In theory the difference is big. But from my experience,&nbsp;based on teaching in the United States, United Kingdom, and&nbsp;South Africa, I learned that in practice we are close, and agree&nbsp;quite often on standards for education and amount of practical&nbsp;training. The main difference is that in the Netherlands we also&nbsp;teach sciences, such as politics, social sciences, and economics.&nbsp;These are tailor-made for the profession and integrate writing&nbsp;and reporting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">CAR training starts in the students’ first year. During one term the students are trained in basic skills: e-mail, the web, search&nbsp;engines, html, spreadsheets, and databases. Sometimes assignments are very specific and isolated; more often assignments are</span></p><div><img src="when-nerds-and-words-collide_files/when-nerds-and-words-collide-24.jpg" style="width:66pt;height:84pt;"/>
<p><span class="font2">Peter J. Verwey is director of the new media department at the School of Journalism at&nbsp;Utrecht in the Netherlands. He teaches courses&nbsp;in computer assisted research and reporting to&nbsp;students in journalism and also conducts training&nbsp;sessions with working journalists. He is regular&nbsp;contributor to dailies and weeklies in the field of&nbsp;new media.</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">45</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
<p><span class="font12">integrated with other subjects. Learning statistics goes hand in hand with learning spreadsheets; and browsing the web connects easily with news research, or writing a story about the&nbsp;latest election in Germany.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Writing articles for newspapers and magazines is the core of practical training, which takes place in our second and third&nbsp;years. In order to teach the ways of publishing and news research, several online magazines are produced by students.&nbsp;</span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Media.nl</span><span class="font12"> is a weekly about the latest developments in journalism and the media. </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Euroviews</span><span class="font12"> is a quarterly about Europe, and is&nbsp;based on students’ travel reports. Both magazines are text&nbsp;oriented, but in the coming months the first multimedia magazines will see the light.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Theory and practice need to go hand in hand. A lecture series for second-year students offers reflections on developments in&nbsp;journalism and communications. We try to incorporate some&nbsp;form of online education in these lectures, using discussion platforms for students to talk with each other and with the speakers.&nbsp;At the end of the lecture series, students are asked to write a&nbsp;paper about the future of the profession.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">At the end of their studies, in the fourth year, students specialize in a beat and in a medium. Digital journalism is the youngest specialization. Among the elements are: news research using&nbsp;discussion lists and news groups; formulating detailed queries&nbsp;for search engines; knowledge about design and publishing on&nbsp;the web; writing for the Internet and using the interactive possibilities; and using spreadsheets and databases for reporting and&nbsp;research.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Last year’s students worked on a project about crime and police. They explored relationships between the crime rate in a police district and the money spent on the police force in that district. The facts were less clear than expected, but presenting these facts on digital maps was an enormous help for further&nbsp;analysis. This also provided a basis for the reporting about the&nbsp;work of the police in certain districts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">After they finish the specialized study and production, students in digital journalism work at online sections of newspapers and magazines as interns. They are successful and seem to fit&nbsp;right in. The demand for these students, however, is greater than&nbsp;the supply. This is a good opportunity for the future.</span></p><h4><a name="bookmark64"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Journalists and the digital newsroom</span></h4>
<p><span class="font12">In one of my training sessions for worldng journalists, an older journalist took the mouse from the desk, directed it toward&nbsp;the screen like a remote control, furiously pressed one of the&nbsp;buttons, and shouted, “It doesn’t work!” A few weeks later I met&nbsp;him again at his desk in the newsroom. Since that session, he&nbsp;had created his own home page, and he was working on a story&nbsp;about the eruption of a volcano using a lot of online sources.&nbsp;Older journalists are not necessary outdated and old-fashioned;&nbsp;some learn very quickly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Most newsrooms are replacing their old systems with PCs, offering software ranging from word processing to databases and spreadsheets. The Internet is a few keystrokes away, while the&nbsp;newsroom generally has its own network with an Internet&nbsp;connection.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Certainly, these journalists need to be trained. Explaining and understanding research on the Internet is not difficult. The&nbsp;problem is learning to handle the abundance of sources on the&nbsp;Internet. Stielstra discovered that “the Internet is growing fast&nbsp;and therefore as the number of hits increases, one needs to be&nbsp;very specific in queries. However, search engines try to address&nbsp;the general user, so the outcome of general search engines for&nbsp;journalists is often disappointing.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Finally determining the reliability of sources on the Internet strikes the working journalist as a big problem. Of course the&nbsp;reliability of the information is determined by the source, but&nbsp;how do journalists check information from newsgroups and&nbsp;discussions lists? This is a much-discussed issue during training&nbsp;sessions.</span></p><h4><a name="bookmark65"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The future</span></h4>
<p><span class="font12">How did TV or radio look 10 years after they were introduced? Computer assisted journalism is looking good after 10 years. Of course, we are waiting for more bandwidth and faster&nbsp;computers in order to have real multimedia productions. But&nbsp;CAR has lots of prospects.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The tools available to journalists are growing. A laptop including a camera and a microphone will become standard&nbsp;equipment. Journalists will edit and produce the items on the&nbsp;spot and send them over a network to a central desk where the&nbsp;decision will be made where and how these items will be&nbsp;published.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">At the same time, journalists have new tools to do some investigative reporting. Spreadsheets and databases to analyze public records are now being discovered. Dick van Eijk of </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">NRC Han-delsblad</span><span class="font12"> recently published a magnificent story about rich and&nbsp;poor neighborhoods in Dutch cities, using advanced spreadsheets and digital mapping.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The profession will be enriched with new jobs related to journalism, such as system editor, webmaster, and researcher.&nbsp;Classical journalism education needs to be enhanced with Information Technology (IT). And other IT specialists need to have at&nbsp;least some journalistic training in order to work with journalists.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The digital revolution will end the distinctions among radio, television, and newspaper journalists. The development toward&nbsp;new multimedia news products will force journalists to be educated in all the media, in order to switch from radio to video or text.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The aim of all journalism is to inform the public. An important question is whether this new technology has something to add. A clear answer has not been found. The new media are&nbsp;gaining acceptance; but how much can you leam from zapping&nbsp;over web pages? And finally there is government, experimenting with a new electronic democracy for which an electronic,&nbsp;informed public is prerequisite.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">It is safe to conclude that technological development influences the changes in communication and journalism toward digital journalism. But this process of change in the past 10&nbsp;years has hardly been controlled; it just happened. It is time that&nbsp;some reflection starts about the goals we have for this change:&nbsp;informing the public and improving the realization of our democratic ideas.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">By Randy Reddick</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">My place in the CAR world would be that of an advocate for using online research in news reporting and for incorporating&nbsp;the whole gamut of CAR within the curriculum of college&nbsp;journalism education. I’ve written books and articles on the subjects and participated in numerous panels and workshops in the&nbsp;last decade. I came into this position through a slow, groping,&nbsp;tortuous path that developed into a major highway by 1993.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Here’s how.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">I had double-majored in chemistry and biology. By the time hand-held calculators became common household implements,&nbsp;I was a general assignment reporter for a small daily newspaper&nbsp;in central California.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">That newspaper converted to offset printing and cold type in 1968.1 got involved in maintaining those machines and a new&nbsp;composing room tool - a dedicated word processor. By 1980,&nbsp;we had several of these word processors, a number of phototypesetters, and a Compugraphic OCR device that was really hot</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;when it worked. As managing editor of </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">The Daily Press</span><span class="font12"> in&nbsp;Paso Robles, Calif., and company vice president, I had responsibility for computerizing our newsroom and classified operations. The following year I computerized the circulation and display advertising operations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The mainframe computer that drove both our news front end and classified advertising sat in a small room with its own air&nbsp;conditioning and power. In the course of daily data file maintenance, we “talked” to the computer through a Texas Instruments&nbsp;KSR (Keyboard-Send and Receive) 820. One day in 1984, the&nbsp;KSR quit working. The people at Texas Instruments said it&nbsp;would cost $720 for their technicians to set foot on our property</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sometime in the next 72 hours. When I argued that we were a&nbsp;daily newspaper and could not afford 72 hours of down time, TI&nbsp;invited me to purchase a “preferred maintenance” contract for&nbsp;only $15,000 per year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">I left the service call open, but I was determined to do what I could to solve the problem myself. It took me about four hours.&nbsp;In the process, I had to download a shareware communications&nbsp;program (ProComm) from a bulletin board in San Jose. I was&nbsp;wide-eyed with my first views of FIDO Net and the wealth of&nbsp;information to which it could connect me. I had become “connected.” Through FIDO Net I found EPA reports and data sets,&nbsp;some FDA information, and even material from the National&nbsp;Institutes of Health. I learned that the Internet was some&nbsp;mysterious system that allowed different networks, such as&nbsp;FIDO Net and CompuServe, to exchange information.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">In 1985,1 set up a newsroom bulletin board. Our county-seat correspondent began filing stories directly with us so that we&nbsp;were no longer at the mercy of a pony wire. Soon a political&nbsp;columnist working out of Colorado began using our BBS, and&nbsp;then we began helping a news service based in the state capital&nbsp;get ready for the online age.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The 75th anniversary of Boy Scouts of America in 1985 presented a unique opportunity for me to put this new technology to</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">work. I carried a Radio Shack TRS-80 Model 100 computer with me as I accompanied a group of Scouts on a two-week tour that&nbsp;culminated at the National Jamboree in Fort A.P. Hill, Va. I filed&nbsp;daily reports directly into the computers of AP’s Los Angeles&nbsp;bureau.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">During this same time (1984-85), I also got involved with spreadsheet and database software. Intuitively, I began to put&nbsp;some of this to work in the newsroom. I set up some automatic&nbsp;team and league statistics calculators for our sports desk. I&nbsp;poured key city and county budget numbers into spreadsheets.&nbsp;And I assumed that “all reporters” at larger news operations&nbsp;(most of the country) were doing the same.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Not until I attended one of Jim Brown’s NIAR conferences did I realize what a limited practice CAR was. By that time I had&nbsp;left the newsroom for the academy. I had gone back to school in&nbsp;1988 to earn a doctorate and to research the likely impact of&nbsp;digital information access and services on more traditional news&nbsp;media. Within the journalism educators’ association (AEJMC), I&nbsp;had become something of an advocate for CAR, especially for&nbsp;doing online research for news stories.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">It was often discouraging work. I organized a panel at Boston in 1991 that included Jim Brown of Indianapolis, Dorothy&nbsp;Bowles of Knoxville, folks from </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">The Boston Globe</span><span class="font12">, and others.&nbsp;At the appointed hour, our panelists outnumbered our audience.&nbsp;I had similarly discouraging experiences with educators well&nbsp;into 1992.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">In the fall of 1992,1 wrote an article in an academic newsletter in which I cited and played off an article that Tom Johnson had&nbsp;written for </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Quill</span><span class="font12"> magazine. Using Johnson’s arguments, I asked&nbsp;journalism professors to respond to the charge that journalism&nbsp;programs failing to teach the entire range of CAR were committing fraud upon their clientele. I included my e-mail address and&nbsp;other contact information. A good number of folks responded -most of them agreeing that universities should be teaching CAR.&nbsp;Many of those, however, asked, “But who is going to teach the&nbsp;teachers?” The answers started coming in 1993.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Encouraged by this response, I organized for the 1993 AEJMC convention in Kansas City one “last” set of panels for&nbsp;journalism professors. Scheduled back-to-back during a four-hour&nbsp;block through the heart of the convention, these panels on doing&nbsp;online research attracted more than 200 attendees. One of the panels dealt with commercial databases (such as Lexis-Nexis and&nbsp;Dialog), and one of the panels discussed the Internet. Both sessions were “sold out,” and it was clear that we had finally caught</span></p><div><img src="when-nerds-and-words-collide_files/when-nerds-and-words-collide-25.jpg" style="width:67pt;height:85pt;"/>
<p><span class="font2">Randy Reddick is editor and director of FACSNET, an online research service. Reddick was a managing editor of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Daily Press,</span><span class="font2"> where he won state&nbsp;recognition for a project examining land use&nbsp;management and national recognition for spot&nbsp;news reporting in 1987.

<p><span class="font12">the attention of a significant number of journalism educators.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">That year, I organized the online exploration notes I had been taking, teamed up with Dr. Elliot King of Loyola College in Baltimore, and sold a book proposal for what became </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">The Online&nbsp;Journalist,</span><span class="font12"> published by Harcourt Brace College Publishers.&nbsp;The book landed on college campuses late in 1994 and was followed by contracts for three other books having to do with using&nbsp;the Internet to do research. </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">The Online Journalist</span><span class="font12"> has been translated into four other languages and is scheduled for release of a&nbsp;third English language edition in the fall of 1999.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">During the AEJMC national convention in Atlanta in 1995,1 secured use of computer labs at Georgia State, three blocks from&nbsp;the convention hotel. For three days, we ran hands-on sessions on&nbsp;spreadsheets, database software, e-mail, and Internet 101. The&nbsp;same year I began doing a number of training sessions, panel appearances, and seminars that took me into newsrooms and conferences on two continents. I have since worked not only with&nbsp;AEJMC but also with several other educational organizations,&nbsp;professional journalism groups, and various news companies.</span></p><h4><a name="bookmark66"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Where we’ve come</span></h4>
<p><span class="font12">I recognized quickly the value of Internet resources for doing news background work and for reference. Until January 1994,1&nbsp;wasn’t sure the Internet was mature enough to be useful for&nbsp;research on breaking news. The Northridge, Calif., earthquake&nbsp;of Jan. 17, 1994, changed that. The California Office of Emergency Services ran a bulletin board that was accessible by&nbsp;Telnet. Within an hour of the 4:30 a.m. quake, it had posted a&nbsp;notice that confirmed the presence of a serious temblor. OES&nbsp;promised in its notice that it would be posting frequent updates.&nbsp;OES officials made good on that promise, listing road closures,&nbsp;reports of damages, fires, gas leaks, toxic spills, aftershocks,&nbsp;injuries, and deaths. As efforts to deal with the quake aftermath&nbsp;progressed, the OES bulletin board earned reports of relief and&nbsp;rescue operations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Many people in the quake area clamored onto the Internet to post their observations to Usenet news groups, e-mail discussion&nbsp;lists, and to engage in real-time discussion on Internet Relay&nbsp;Chat channels. News people in the Los Angeles area created one&nbsp;of those channels as a public service and a newsgathering tool.&nbsp;And, of course, all the timeless data about earthquakes, including lists of the largest and most destructive quakes, were already&nbsp;archived and available at several sites. Information obtainable&nbsp;during the hours following the Northridge quake convinced me&nbsp;that the Internet could be a valuable research tool for breaking&nbsp;news. All this occurred before the big explosion of interest in the</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">World Wide Web that has brought so many resources and so many journalists onto the Internet.</span></p><h4><a name="bookmark67"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Progress yet to come</span></h4>
<p><span class="font12">A lot has changed since then. Today journalists no longer ask, “What is the Internet?’’ Most know how to use e-mail, and they&nbsp;have had some experience with browsing software. Many have&nbsp;used Internet resources for doing story research. Today, journalists ask two questions most often. They want to know how to find&nbsp;information they seek quickly, and they want to know how they&nbsp;can measure the credibility of information found online. These&nbsp;two questions will continue for the near future to be important in&nbsp;the newsgathering business. Other questions of importance in the&nbsp;near future will address rights to story content, pressures to be&nbsp;first with a stoiy, ethical limits on collaboration, and how best to&nbsp;use this new medium.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Questions of stoiy content rights have risen on at least two levels. On one level are sites that attract Internet readers, in part,&nbsp;by offering content prepared by news organizations. In this situation, the site uses news stories from the websites of news organizations. In extreme cases, these folks serve the content within&nbsp;frames that are surrounded by other frames containing advertising for which the pirate site collects revenue. On another level,&nbsp;some reporters and free-lance writers have complained that they&nbsp;should receive additional compensation when stories prepared&nbsp;for print are republished on the web.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">In the second arena, journalists have long dealt with the tension between competition to be first and the need to get the&nbsp;story right. With online publishing, traditional news cycles give&nbsp;way to constant deadlines. The traditional tension between these&nbsp;two forces will continue to beg resolution.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Through e-mail discussion lists and Usenet news groups, journalists from different news organizations are able to collaborate with one another. Each day, they share information on how&nbsp;to develop certain kinds of news stories, what kinds of sources&nbsp;to use on a particular story, and even tips on dealing with government agencies. In former days it was a professional taboo for&nbsp;journalists representing competing news agencies to share&nbsp;notes. Traditional geographical lines no longer define competition. Online forums by their nature are open, and any information shared is freely available globally. News people of the future will have to resolve issues that surround collaboration.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Finally, it is clear that in an interactive environment, individual audience members actually play a part in shaping each story. Clearly, this new medium with new capabilities will demand&nbsp;new writing, researching, and packaging skills.</span></p><div>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">By Anne Saul</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">My perspective of computer assisted reporting might be different from most because I am not in a newsroom - and&nbsp;haven’t worked in one for eight years. Not only that, I never&nbsp;actually used CAR because it was an unknown tool when I was&nbsp;a reporter back in the “dark ages.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">I came into CAR because the putpose of my current job is to help our newsrooms deal with technology. Obviously, that&nbsp;includes a lot of front-end systems work, but only a few months&nbsp;into my then-new job, it became clear that our reporters needed&nbsp;help with technology, too.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The problem was that short of using a spreadsheet program to produce a newsroom budget, </span><span class="font11">1</span><span class="font12"> knew nothing about the tools&nbsp;required for computer assisted reporting - let alone how to use&nbsp;them. So, in the spring of 19911 attended my first CAR conference - the National Institute for Advanced Reporting. I’m not&nbsp;sure how much I learned at that conference - other than how little I really did know.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Two years later, I attended the first National Institute for Computer Assisted Reporting conference in Raleigh, N.C.&nbsp;That’s when everything began to make sense, and I knew what&nbsp;needed to be done at our newspapers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Shortly after that conference, we assembled a task force of reporters, editors, and others from our newspapers to address&nbsp;how we were going to get these new tools into the hands of our&nbsp;reporters and how we were going to teach them to use the tools.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">As a result of that meeting, we started a series of on-the-road training sessions aimed at teaching Gannett reporters and midlevel editors the basics of computer assisted reporting. Each&nbsp;session lasted three days and included hands-on training in&nbsp;spreadsheets and databases. Initially, Jennifer LaFleur, then&nbsp;NICAR training director, conducted the hands-on sessions, but&nbsp;after she left NICAR, we felt comfortable enough to assume that&nbsp;task. We also made sure that every newsroom had spreadsheet&nbsp;and database software; if it didn’t, we purchased it. In a three-year period we provided basic CAR training for more than 160&nbsp;reporters and editors from 56 of our 75 newspapers. (By design&nbsp;we focused on our larger newspapers because we felt their&nbsp;staffers were more likely to use the skills.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">We also created a private listserv so that Gannett reporters and editors could continue to help each other. The list has about 90&nbsp;members and is fairly active. It also has a website on which&nbsp;members can post stories, data, executable software programs,&nbsp;and so on, to share with others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">And we have seen very rewarding results from this training -as well as the training provided at the annual NICAR conferences, which are attended by 50 to 80 of our reporters and&nbsp;editors each year. Clearly our newsrooms - many of them quite&nbsp;small - are using their computer assisted reporting skills to&nbsp;provide more depth and sophistication to their stories - and to do&nbsp;some truly original project work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">I think this reflects what is happening around the country. Reporters and editors who were rank beginners at the Raleigh</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">NICAR conference are now teaching advanced techniques. The addition of more advanced workshop and hands-on sessions at&nbsp;NICAR conferences reflect that same shift in the level of&nbsp;expertise that has evolved in the past five years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Unfortunately, this is not true everywhere - and that brings me to one of the issues that needs to be addressed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">At our training sessions, we required that at least one participant from each newspaper be an editor, primarily because we wanted to make sure that someone in a position of authority&nbsp;could work with the reporters to ensure that they were given the&nbsp;time and assistance necessary to put their skills to work. In many&nbsp;cases that worked well; in some it didn’t.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Some mid-level editors have told me that they have a hard time convincing their fellow editors that CAR is a worthwhile&nbsp;skill. For that reason, they say it is difficult to get other editors to&nbsp;free up reporters’ time to work on CAR stories. As a result, the&nbsp;trained reporters get discouraged, give up, and, in some cases,&nbsp;leave the newspaper, taking what little they remember with&nbsp;them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Even some of those who have learned the skills - and who are doing CAR work - have not done a good job of passing those&nbsp;skills along to others in their newsrooms.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Many top editors are woefully ignorant of the value of computer assisted reporting - or even the value of web resources&nbsp;for everyday reporting. They’ll send someone to a three-day&nbsp;training session and assume that’s all the reporter needs. I find&nbsp;tins incomprehensible, since these same editors appear to understand that it takes continuing training to produce good writers.&nbsp;The top editors also are ignorant of the time it takes to do CAR&nbsp;work; they figure if you’re using a computer to do the calculations and searches it should be faster than doing it by hand. It is,&nbsp;of course, but these editors fail to realize how long it takes to&nbsp;clean up the data.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">By the same token, many reporters have the same attitude. They find out that CAR is hard work, and they don’t want to put&nbsp;forth the effort. Of course, most learn this after the initial&nbsp;training session, so if basic training weeds out the less dedicated,&nbsp;perhaps it serves its purpose.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Not surprisingly, our most successful CAR efforts are from newspapers in which a reporter or editor truly loves the work&nbsp;and is willing to find the time to do it - regardless of the&nbsp;obstacles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Speaking of which, there still are equipment and access obstacles. Despite the fact that many newspapers are installing</span></p><div><img src="when-nerds-and-words-collide_files/when-nerds-and-words-collide-26.jpg" style="width:67pt;height:85pt;"/>
<p><span class="font2">Anne Saul began her career as a reporter at the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Pensacola News Journal</span><span class="font2"> in 1966 and moved to&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Orlando Sentinel</span><span class="font2"> in 1968. She joined </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Today</span><span class="font2"> at&nbsp;Cocoa, Fla., in 1968 and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">USA Today</span><span class="font2"> in 1982. Her&nbsp;current job includes advising editors at Gannett&nbsp;newspapers in all areas of technology. She also&nbsp;coordinates CAR training for Gannett, was a&nbsp;co-designer of API’s interactive learning project,&nbsp;and she publishes a newsletter.</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">49</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
<p><span class="font12">PC- and Mac-based systems, others still are on legacy front-end systems, with only one or two PCs in a corner on which to do&nbsp;CAR work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Internet access in too many newsrooms is still through America Online and a slow modem. This is true even in some&nbsp;newsrooms with new PC- or Mac-based systems. The issue&nbsp;usually is one of cost for a T-1 line or ISDN access and a firewall&nbsp;server, but in some cases it’s also based on systems personnel&nbsp;not wanting to do the work required to install or support the&nbsp;systems. Unfortunately they often are able to convince&nbsp;computer-ignorant publishers that aliens will invade the newspaper if Internet access is allowed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">I do believe this will change - albeit slowly - not because reporters need web access but because those on the revenue side&nbsp;of the operation need access. As more newspapers produce more&nbsp;web products, advertising sales reps need to sell for that medium&nbsp;- and they can’t sell advertising for websites if they’ve never&nbsp;used, or don’t have access to, the web. If that improves Internet-access capabilities for our newsrooms, who cares how it&nbsp;happens?</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">I have spent a lot of time talking - and listening - to our newspapers’ systems managers. I think it’s important to be non-combative and to understand their concerns. But I am firm in my&nbsp;message that the Internet is an important tool that they have to&nbsp;find a way to provide access to. By the same token, I talk to our&nbsp;editors about teaching safe surfing and responsibility.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Cost also is a factor. Despite the fact that NICAR conference registration is low (and we even provided meals during our&nbsp;regional training sessions), some newspapers are unable (or&nbsp;unwilling) to pay transportation and hotel costs for trainees.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">One solution might be online training or interactive learning programs, such as the one provided by the American Press&nbsp;Institute.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">In the spring of 1997, Neill Borowski of </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">The Philadelphia Inquirer</span><span class="font12"> and I participated in the API pilot project to develop the&nbsp;institute’s interactive learning program for CAR. While interactive learning is not as good as a classroom environment, it is a&nbsp;solution for newsrooms strapped for training dollars (although I&nbsp;think the API tuition of nearly $600 still is too high).</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Over a six-week period, we taught a combined class of 24 students CAR concepts, how to use the Internet and the web,&nbsp;where to find data, how to develop stories, etc. Because we did&nbsp;not have the capability of teaching spreadsheet and database&nbsp;software online, we initially did not include that in the course.&nbsp;However, it became clear that the students wanted those skills,&nbsp;and so I taught both in a “chat” environment. (And I am thankful</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">to this day for Windows’ programs cut-and-paste capabilities that allowed me to do this!)</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Unlike a classroom situation in which the audience is captive, there are problems with an interactive learning environment.&nbsp;Students drop out because they are involved in a breaking news&nbsp;story at their newspapers. If they miss a week, they feel they&nbsp;can’t catch up, and so they don’t come back, despite the fact that&nbsp;we broke down the components so that one week was not dependent on the next. Some supervising editors also didn’t build in&nbsp;time during the normal workday for staffers to work on our assignments or to participate in scheduled “chats” (a vehicle we&nbsp;found to be particularly useful in the CAR course).</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">All that said, I do think that interactive learning is a useful alternative to classroom or workshop training when money is a&nbsp;factor. It was very rewarding to see some of our students (none&nbsp;of whom had been exposed to CAR before our course) produce&nbsp;stories using the CAR skills they had learned in our course.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">There’s also the issue of training at the university level. I sit on the advisory council for the University of Florida College of&nbsp;Journalism, and have been pushing the college to provide a&nbsp;CAR course for several years. Three years ago, the college started offering a class taught on an adjunct basis. (Debbie Wolfe of&nbsp;the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">St. Petersburg Times</span><span class="font12"> taught it one semester. See her essay on&nbsp;page 51.) Because of its location, finding adjuncts willing to&nbsp;come to Gainesville even one day a week is much more difficult&nbsp;than it is at universities in larger cities (such as Temple, where&nbsp;Borowski teaches on an adjunct basis).</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Ideally, of course, colleges of journalism should have fulltime faculty teaching a CAR class every semester. But college professors (Phil Meyer and John Ullman aside) don’t get the&nbsp;training for the same reasons that many of our reporters and&nbsp;editors don’t get it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">In addition, professors sometimes are reluctant to add to their teaching load. Some of this is justified in the case of professors&nbsp;with heavy teaching loads; some of it is not. It’s also no secret&nbsp;that many college professors haven’t been in a newsroom for&nbsp;years and are still teaching their classes with the same syllabus&nbsp;they used 20 years ago. Nevertheless, I think we have to keep&nbsp;pushing our colleges and universities to teach CAR skills - and&nbsp;eventually to build it into then<sup>-</sup> curricula.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Despite the obstacles, I am not discouraged. I have seen great strides made in CAR training - and the results of that training -in the past five years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">And I use myself as an example. If a middle-aged woman who never touched a computer until </span><span class="font11">10</span><span class="font12"> years ago can leant this&nbsp;stuff, anyone can.</span></p><div>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">By Debbie Wolfe</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Pssst. The revolution is over. Here’s why.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The first decade of reporting with computers was punctuated by anecdotal progress that was often painfully slow. Many&nbsp;newsrooms had one or two experienced journalists (most often a&nbsp;beat reporter, sometimes a news researcher or news librarian)&nbsp;who served as visionaries sensing that access to electronic public records would radically transform how journalists did their&nbsp;jobs. Most journalists were reluctant to associate themselves&nbsp;with a new way of accessing traditional information.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The chutzpah of change had a high price tag.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Computer hardware and software costs were measured in multiples of $</span><span class="font11">10,000</span><span class="font12"> just to minimally equip a single work&nbsp;station. Blocks of time measured in multiples of months were&nbsp;needed to produce a story or series for the printed page.&nbsp;Convincing bean counters and line editors to commit these&nbsp;resources to a new way of doing things was a very hard sell,&nbsp;especially since the visionaries lacked newsroom rank and colleague support.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The lone rangers began to realize the value of numbers in more ways than just counting records on a 9-track tape.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Annual group therapy sessions for fledgling geeks began at Indiana University in Indianapolis and were later organized by&nbsp;the Investigative Reporters and Editors. The visionaries derived&nbsp;strength and direction from each other. IRE’s mandatory annual&nbsp;membership requirement made its association rolls soar with&nbsp;each new conference. “Computer assisted reporting” and&nbsp;“computer assisted reporting editor” were soon coined as the&nbsp;universal themes for the new electronic revolution in newsrooms. The lone rangers from the special project desks began&nbsp;organizing and learning how to function as a national collective&nbsp;- a CAR team.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">All of this was accomplished without organized hands-on training. Visionaries were self-starters and, for the most part,&nbsp;read manuals to learn how to access and analyze electronic data.&nbsp;Life looked good for a short while.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Then, at the peak of the CAR revolution, there was a revolt.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Beat reporters and increasing numbers of news researchers wanted in on the star status of CAR. They wanted access to&nbsp;technology and the prestige associated with spending months&nbsp;reporting a single story or project.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The price of change was increasing. Bean counters and line editors began to balk. Where was the money for technology&nbsp;going to come from? And if many people in news were researching and writing CAR stories, who would be left to put out the&nbsp;daily paper?</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Almost overnight, a shift occurred. IRE’s members once again realized the power of numbers, and team journalism&nbsp;broadened its scope to include the beat reporting troops. The&nbsp;conference in Raleigh, N.C., was a turning point. It emphasized&nbsp;hands-on training labs. Once beat reporters got a taste of the&nbsp;power of electronic records, there was no looking back. How to&nbsp;move forward became the big question.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">How do you get more technology in the newsroom? How do you keep people current in rapidly changing technology? How&nbsp;do you keep from being run over and buried by the information&nbsp;explosion? How do you get CAR in the paper on a regular basis&nbsp;- maybe even every day?</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The answer was training. Specifically, hands-on training in local newsrooms.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">For training to work it had to be more frequent than a once-a-year infusion at a national IRE conference, especially since news budgets were not large enough to send every beat reporter&nbsp;who wanted to learn. The job description of CAR editors began&nbsp;to include teaching as well as data acquisition, storage and&nbsp;archiving, analysis, reporting, writing, and editing. People were&nbsp;overwhelmed. A new focus to organize the revolution was&nbsp;needed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The training theme began as a post-conference “what should we do next year” discussion in 1990 when faculty members at&nbsp;Indiana University and a few journalists sat in the bar and tossed&nbsp;around ways to incorporate hands-on sessions. The cost and&nbsp;logistics of setting up just one training lab proved to be a large&nbsp;hurdle.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">In 1993, the IRE conference in Raleigh emphasized multiple hands-on training labs and served as a model for what newsrooms should do back on their home turf. </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">The News &amp; Observer&nbsp;</span><span class="font12">was really the first paper to set up an organized in-house&nbsp;technology training program.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">By the San Jose conference in 1994, the hands-on training issue was picking up steam. The conference continued to have&nbsp;multiple hands-on training rooms and a handful of newspapers&nbsp;had already begun experimenting with in-house technical&nbsp;training programs or “universities.” In these early times,&nbsp;reporters, researchers, or systems editors were wearing training&nbsp;hats in addition to their regular job duties. It was after this&nbsp;conference that the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">St. Petersburg Times</span><span class="font12"> agreed to create a new&nbsp;position for me - they made me a full-time technology trainer&nbsp;for the news department.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The IRE national computer conferences continued to emphasize hands-on training labs, and interest in ways to organize local technical training was starting to gain momentum.&nbsp;Getting IRE to address how news organizations could create&nbsp;their own local training programs was a bit of a straggle.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">At Cleveland’s 1995 conference the issue was addressed in a last-minute roundtable addition to the formal schedule (cochaired by myself and Diane Weeks from </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">The Washington Post).</span></p><div><img src="when-nerds-and-words-collide_files/when-nerds-and-words-collide-27.jpg" style="width:67pt;height:85pt;"/>
<p><span class="font2">Debbie Wolfe is the technology training editor at the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">St. Petersburg Times.</span><span class="font2"> She's been a reporter,&nbsp;managing editor, photojournalist, design editor,&nbsp;special projects editor, journalism educator, and a&nbsp;news researcher. Currently she's the full-time&nbsp;teacher for 400 journalists with more than 40&nbsp;separate classes on computers and electronic&nbsp;information. She also helps supervise beat projects related to technology and public records.</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">51</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
<p><span class="font12">About 20 people attended. For the Providence, R.I., conference in 1996, it took a flurry of e-mail messages among interested&nbsp;members to make it a part of the formal schedule. It certainly&nbsp;didn’t hurt that Stephen Miller of </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">The New York Times</span><span class="font12"> joined the&nbsp;cause.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">By 1997 in Nashville, hundreds of people attended the panel session co-led by Miller, Weeks, and myself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Newsroom technology training had come of age when it was recognized as the local and national answer for moving forward.&nbsp;The CAR revolution had ended, and the evolution was under&nbsp;way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">At one panel hosted by Miller and in the halls of the Indianapolis conference in 1998, many members were asking the question - where are we headed now?</span></p><h4><a name="bookmark69"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The next 10 years</span></h4>
<p><span class="font12">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The majority of newsrooms will establish regular and&nbsp;continuing in-house technology training programs to augment&nbsp;national and regional conferences.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;National and regional conferences will shift their focus to&nbsp;covering trends and “How I Wrote the Story” issues rather than&nbsp;trying to organize topic-specific hands-on training for the&nbsp;masses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outsourcing news technology training to the human&nbsp;resources department or local training firms or local colleges&nbsp;and universities will dramatically decrease.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Technology training will be done increasingly by a separate&nbsp;FTE position within the news department. This is a new career&nbsp;path in the journalism industry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Technology training programs will be enhanced by regular&nbsp;visits from professional journalists turned consultants who&nbsp;specialize in topics such as: training the trainers, creating contin</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">uing training programs, mining all the gold from electronic data, special technical applications in spreadsheets, relational&nbsp;databases, and web-based (intranet) look-up applications. Consultants will serve to infuse local programs with customized&nbsp;detail.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Computer assisted paragraphs” on a daily basis for nearly&nbsp;every beat will become the norm.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Producing the news report will become more of a&nbsp;cooperative effort among journalists worldwide.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By 2009, it will be commonplace to see traditional print&nbsp;and broadcast media combining budgetary resources and newsroom talents to create the “new” journalism media, which will&nbsp;be electronic.</span></p><h4><a name="bookmark70"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">And after that?</span></h4>
<p><span class="font12">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;News organizations will have increasingly global staffs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Worldwide, colleges and universities will incorporate&nbsp;practical skills-based journalism into each course using state-of-the-art technology financed by industry and corporations.&nbsp;Hands-on technology training will be completed before entering&nbsp;the professional job market for the next generations of&nbsp;journalists.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Internships will be worldwide in focus rather than national.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Colleges and universities will hire professional journalists,&nbsp;experienced in the global arena, as consultants on a regular basis&nbsp;to infuse their local technology training programs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In-house newsroom programs will shift toward maintenance of data warehouses that will be shared among news&nbsp;organizations in geographically regional and globally topical&nbsp;cooperative agreements.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The era of worldwide electronic journalism will be in full&nbsp;swing by 2019.</span></p><div>

<p><span class="font15">About The Poynter Institute</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Poynter Institute is a school for journalists, future journalists, and teachers of journalists. Our students come here in a search for excellence. Our teachers provide concentrated instruction and personal support in that quest. We focus our programs to serve specific audiences, but all share the same approach. The Institute prides itself on a style&nbsp;of teaching and learning that helps shape every course and seminar we offer into a&nbsp;&quot;Poynter Experience.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Our academic program is organized around four broad areas of print and broadcast journalism: reporting, writing, editing, and research; visual journalism; leadership and&nbsp;management; and media ethics, with attention given to the places where these disciplines intersect.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We keep seminars small, which means participants get lots of individual attention. We emphasize a hands-on approach, so they participate in brainstorming sessions, case&nbsp;studies, discussions, role-playing, and other exercises to get them involved in their own&nbsp;learning.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Our resident faculty includes scholars, distinguished professionals, and master teachers who bring special expertise to every session. Each seminar includes visiting faculty, accomplished professionals who leave their jobs for a week to help teach, who spend&nbsp;time with participants inside and outside the classroom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We want our students to leave Poynter better prepared to produce quality journalism, so that readers, viewers, or listeners can make better informed decisions. We want them&nbsp;to be equipped with new tools to handle the challenges of producing authoritative, responsible, and creative news reports, programs, and publications, and with new ways of&nbsp;thinking about the work they do.</span></p><h1><a name="bookmark71"></a><span class="font20">Poynter.</span></h1><div>
