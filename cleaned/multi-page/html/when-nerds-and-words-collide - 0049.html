  colleagues were put on the back burner. Instead, we worked intensively on articles to prove the value of CAR. That has resulted in a number of good articles, and over time electronic data have been created - data that have been used in other news articles.
 </p>
 <p>
  Svith and I also have had the opportunity to write a CAR textbook based on the experience in Denmark.
 </p>
 <p>
  Where do we go from here? Here are my immediate concerns and personal views.
 </p>
 <p>
  ■    Most important is making the association and the institute run stably now that they have been established - very much like IRE/NICAR in the United States. The Danish institute is still weak, and it will take a special effort to make it stronger.
 </p>
 <p>
  ■    One of the institute’s (and Danish CAR journalists’) major tasks will be to get an overview of all the material Danish authorities place on the Internet these days. There is a flood of data that need to be structured and compared with other data and journalistic leads.
 </p>
 <p>
  ■    Continue the dialogue with the authorities concerning specific experiments with mailing lists and access to electronic documents, and the broader and more fundamental issue of formulating proposals for law reform.
 </p>
 <p>
  ■    Consider CAR in connection with Internet publication and intranets - already very much an issue in the United States.
 </p>
 <p>
  ■    Consider how the CAR method should function in connection with other computer assisted tools such as group work and mobile work.
 </p>
 <p>
  ■    It is still (and this is very important) necessary to work to generate more really good articles based on CAR. Perhaps in a few years when there will be a considerable number of active CAR journalists, it would be a good idea to institute a special prize for this type of journalism.
 </p>
 <p>
  ■    CAR should be made an integrated part of the training at all three schools of journalism in Denmark.
 </p>
 <p>
  Looking further ahead, I see the following tasks for CAR:
 </p>
 <p>
  ■    Basically, the aim is to secure democracy in the society of the future. Computers enable the authorities to exercise expert
 </p>
 <p>
  power to an even greater extent without the citizens and the media being able to exercise control. We must do whatever we can to eliminate this imbalance. One of the key issues will be to secure the public’s right to be informed.
 </p>
 <p>
  ■    We should probably also consider how to make CAR an established part of our profession. That would specifically require more contact with other associations and more joint activities.
 </p>
 <p>
  ■    We should work to create a special set of CAR ethics. If the aim is better journalism and monitoring authorities, it will take a different kind of credibility with the public than journalism normally enjoys. We can set a high standard from the beginning. In any case, the performance of CAR demands that more attention be paid to ethics than is the case with traditional journalism.
 </p>
 <p>
  ■    In Denmark there is very limited research within the field of journalism, and journalists tend not to read books and have a theoretical approach to their profession. If, in the longer term, DICAR can be instrumental in carrying out proper research and strengthening the theoretical aspect of the profession, I can only support it.
 </p>
 <p>
  ■    International cooperation is another issue. CAR has already brought about international contacts, especially to American and Swedish journalists, and some contact between Danish CAR journalists. This trend will surely continue. At
  <em>
   Jyllands-Posten
  </em>
  we tried to find out whether an international project would be possible. Nothing came out of it, but it would be an excellent project once the routine is better integrated in Denmark.
 </p>
 <p>
  ■    Last, but not least, there is the issue of international cooperation concerning law and rules. In this field, the whole Internet regulation and the European Union (EU) directive on personal data will make cooperation necessary. We have tried on a very small scale, but so far the effort has had no practical significance. I believe that this could quickly appear on the agenda, and then we must have a good and appropriate framework within which to tackle it. I have not yet quite figured out how this will be achieved.
